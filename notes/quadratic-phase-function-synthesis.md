# Quadratic Phase Function Synthesis

**Quadratic Phase Function Synthesis** is the process of developing the [[phase]] and [[frequency]] of [[sine-wave|sinusoidal]] components in the [[additive-synthesis|additive synthesis]] phase of [[mcaulay-quatieri-algorithm|MQ]] analysis and synthesis.

The MQ algorithm uses [[quadratic-interpolation|quadratic interpolation]] to synthesize phase information by matching phase and bin frequency at each peak of each [[fast-fourier-transform|FFT]] at each [[spectrum-analysis-window|window]].
