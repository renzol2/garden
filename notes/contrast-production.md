# Contrast (production)

How to add contrast in production:

- Dropping the bass or soloing the vocals before and after the chorus to increase contrast (re: [[hyperpop]])
- remove bass or all but 1-2 elements before drop
- add staccato vs. legato sections
- use mastering knob to reduce stereo width, highs, and lows before drop (re: [[10-music-production-tricks-au5]])
- add musical transitions
