# Bandlimiting

**Bandlimiting** is the limiting of a signal's [[frequency-domain|frequency domain]] representation to zero above a certain finite [[frequency]] (like a threshold).

- a **band-limited** signal is one whose [[fourier-transform|Fourier transform]] has bounded support
- can be either random (stochastic) or non-random (deterministic)

Used in [[audio-signal]]s to prevent [[aliasing]].
