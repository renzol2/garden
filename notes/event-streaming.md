# Event streaming

Event streaming is the practice of capturing, manipulating, and routing data in real-time from multiple event sources.

- capture data from several _event_ sources, including databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, software applications
- storing _event_ streams durably for later retrieval
- manipulating, processing, and reacting to event streams in real time as well as retrospectively
- routing event streams to different destination technologies as needed

"Event streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system." (Apache)
