# Gender spectrum

The **gender spectrum** is a concept of gender that views gender as a continuum of masculinity and femininity, with some people falling at different points, moving along the spectrum over time, or existing outside the spectrum.

- It is still an extension of the gender binary - a linear model based on a range of 100% to 100% woman, not inclusive of gender identities outside the spectrum
