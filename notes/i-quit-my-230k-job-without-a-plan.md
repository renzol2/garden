# I QUIT MY 230k JOB WITHOUT A PLAN

My notes on Jan Tanja's video "I QUIT MY 230k JOB WITHOUT A PLAN"

How to figure out your life:

- life audit: write down 100 goals you want to achieve, no matter how big or how small
  - see patterns and similarities in your goals
  - see how to pivot your life towards your goals
- fill out an Ikigai chart
  - things that fall in the middle are your "ikigai": your purpose in life

Evaluate risks in 6 main areas

1. income
2. debt
3. living expenses
4. job availability
5. runway - how much money do you have left until you need to find a job again
6. obligations

Plan without a plan

- "see things through", until
  - a life goal is reached
  - $10k is spent
- afterwards, re-evaluate and determine whether to go job hunting again
- this results in a safety exit plan in case things go wrong

Once you leave your job

- you have the ability to allocate your own time
- scary, exhilarating
- required discipline and introspection to figure out what your life needs to be

Questions to ask if contemplating quitting job

1. why do you think quitting your job will provide a positive impact on your life? do you think you can provide that impact without quitting your job?
2. are there any immediate drawbacks to quitting your job besides money?
3. which bases do you have covered? ex. income, debt, ability to find another job, etc.
4. what is your backup plan? it's good to have any of the following before quitting your job
   - a side hustle that already makes money that could be taken full time
   - lots of money
   - no obligations
   - young age
   - no debt

Each situation is valid and unique - don't compare yourself to others

- not every field is this abundant (software engineering) in jobs
