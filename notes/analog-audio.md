# Analog audio

**Analog audio** is the representation of [[sound-waves|sound waves]] in the analog domain, in the form of electricity. 

- formed by converting [[sound-waves|sound waves]] (pressure fluctuations over time) into a continuous electrical signal using a transducer, like a [[microphones|microphone]] or a magnetic pickup on an electric instrument (ex. electric guitar).

Any analog signal can be represented by

$$x(t) = \text{amplitude of signal at time $t$}$$

Converting from an analog audio signal to physical sound waves can be done through a [[loudspeakers|loudspeaker]]
