# Person First Language

**Person-first language** is a type of language usage where the emphasis is on the person rather than their [[disability]]

- ex. "Person with [[spinal-cord-injury|spinal cord injury]]" vs. "Paraplegic"
- There exists many philosophies on appropriate language

A way we can highlight the individual and change attitudes towards individuals with disabilities.

- emphasize abilities, not limitations
- recognize people for who they are
- never equate people with a disability
- avoid negative words that imply tragedy
- promote understanding of diversity

## Counterpoint

Some disabled people prefer _identity-first language_ and see person first language as ableist as it downplays their experiences.
