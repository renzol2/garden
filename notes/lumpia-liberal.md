# Lumpia liberal

> "The lumpia Filipino identity essentially describes the self-orientalization that some Filipino Americans partake in. It is the performance of their agency limited to the Western lens as a result of lasting legacies of colonialism and imperialism. They celebrate the representational wins of being Filipino in America with access to cultural imperialism, but fail to grapple with the commodification to that access. Simply, the lumpia Filipino acts to perpetuate capitalism that is reliant on making culture profitable. Therefore, the lumpia Filipino exists as an obstacle to decolonization in the Philippines and, extensively, Filipino diaspora." - Jamelah Jacob
