# Pierre Boulez - Anthémes II

## Background

- Premiered in 1997, 20 minutes
- [[electroacoustic-music|electro-acoustic]] version of Anthèmes I
- Musical parameter of violin detectable by computer
- Modifying & extending the sound of violin, enabling musical material to be projected in any position in space
- **software/hardware agnostic**; general directions + effects are given, but no prescription of how to actually do anything
  - requires a lot of work from the performer/engineer

## Motifs

There are 6 motifs throughout the piece, with different acoustic & electronic characteristics for each

## Functions of Electronics

- extending character of original material in live violin
- facilitates clearer contrasts between each section & materials
- "[[reverb]]" as a musical "comma" (_Libre_ motif)
- "Chaotic processes" and "cloud processes" (II, III)
  - Chaotic processes involve a resampling and random playback of a [[audio-signal|signal]] where it's hard to differentiate between the dry & processed signals
  - Cloud processes are similar, but use effects or other processing to make the difference audibly clear between dry & processed signals
- In motif 2 & 3, the sampled pizzicato runs act as a virtual "second instrument", antiphony to the solo violin (VI)
  - different character from acoustic

## Sound projection

Two options - frontal disposition and central disposition

- 6 or 8 [[loudspeakers|speaker]] channel array + 2 dedicated speakers for amplifying unprocessed sound

Documentation for these kinds of pieces is important for recreation and performance

- this piece has a primarily technical issue, and the composer has left his hands off of it

## Processing modules & cueing

- FS: frequency shifter
- FSD: frequency shifter w/ delay
- 2RMC: two ring modulator mixed to be comb filter
- IR: infinite reverb? impulse response?
- 2/4 HR: 2/4 harmonisers
- HRD: harmoniser with delay
- S: sampler
- S-IR: sampler with infinite reverb
