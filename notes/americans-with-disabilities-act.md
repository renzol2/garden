# Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Early Days of the ADA

- First proposed in 1988 by the National Council on the Handicapped (NCH)
  - Advisory board to the US Department of Education
  - First drafted by Robert Burgdorf Jr.
    - Had an extensive history in [[disability]] advocacy
    - Denied a mechanic internship due to a disability
- First draft quickly disregarded by congress
- Bill reintroduced by Patricia Wright
  - Assistance provided by Democratic Senators Tom Harkin (IA) and Edward Kennedy (MA)
  - "Toned down" from original version
  - Many senators who had family members with disabilities supported the bill
- Despite many family members living with disabilities, George H.W. Bush was opposed to the act despite having many family members with disabilities
  - Convinced by Evan Kemp that individuals with disabilities wanted empowerment, not handouts
- George H.W. Bush was the first president to acknowledge the needs of individuals with disabilities
- Over 180 national disability organizations endorsed by the ADA
  - Still many arguments between individuals with different types of disabilities

## ADA Signing

- Signed into law by 1990 by George H.W. Bush
- Most extensive civil rights legislation since 1964
- Legislation was much more forceful compared to the [[rehabilitation-act-of-1973|Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]
  - Official law vs. requirement to receive reimbursement
- Legislation helped bring together people with different disabilities

## Influence of the ADA

- Businesses would have to make substantial changes to infrastructure
- Transportation systems would require a complete overhaul to accommodate wheelchairs
- Telecommunication systems were required to make services available to those who are deaf/hard of hearing

## ADA Title I: Employment

- Prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in employment
- Title I requires employers with 15 or more employees to _provide qualified individuals_ with disabilities an _equal opportunity_ to benefit from the full range of employment-related opportunities available to others
- Prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, & social activities
- Restricts questions that can be asked about an applicant's disability before a job offer is made
- Requires that employers make _reasonable accommodations_ to the known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities, unless it results in undue hardship

## ADA Title II: State and Local Governments

- Must provide equal opportunity to benefit from programs, services, and activities (e.g. public education, employment, transportation, recreation, healthcare, social services, courts, voting, and town meetings)
- Must follow specific architectural standards in the new construction and alteration of buildings
- Relocate programs or otherwise provide access in inaccessible older buildings; and communicate effectively with people who have hearing, vision, or speech disabilities
- Public entities are not required to take actions that would result in _undue financial and administrative burdens_
- Required to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where necessary to avoid discrimination, unless they can demonstrate that doing so would _fundamentally alter_ the nature of the service, program, or activity being provided

## ADA Title III: Public Accommodations

- Restaurants
- Hotels
- Theaters
- Private Schools
- Doctors' Offices
- Homeless shelters
- Transportation depots
- Zoos
- Funeral homes
- Day care centers
- Recreation facilities
- Transportation services

These organizations must comply with _basic nondiscrimination requirements_ that prohibit exclusion, segregation, and unequal treatment

- must comply with specific requirements related to architectural standards for new and altered buildings
- Reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures
- Effective communication wit people with hearing, vision, or speech disabilities
- Public accommodations must remove barrier sin existing buildings where it is easy to do so without much difficulty or expense, given the public accommodation's resources
- Courses and examinations related to professional, educational, or trade-related applications, licensing, certifications, or credentialing must be accessible

## Life after ADA

- Ambiguous language has led to difficulties enforcing the law
  - "Reasonable accommodations"
  - "Undue hardship"
- Many aspects of the ADA are not enforced
- Continued legislation to open up opportunities for employment, independent living, and improving health and well-being
- ADA continues to be relevant and shapes much of the legislation related to disabilities services
- People with disabilities continue to fight for civil rights
- Like many minority groups, there is still a long way to go!

## ADA Court Cases

### Bragdon v. Abbott

- Woman with AIDS was denied treatment by a dentist
- Court ruling - individual with AIDS was protected under the ADA

### Sutton v. United Airlines (1999)

- Twin sisters with visual impairments (able to be corrected with eyewear) were denied jobs with United Airlines as pilots
- Court ruled in favor of United Airlines - a disability that is easily corrected is not covered under the ADA

### Tennessee v. Lane (2004)

- Inaccessibility of court rooms
- Court ruled that the building had to be accessible
