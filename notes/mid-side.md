# Mide-side recording

TODO: flesh this out

**Mid-side** (MS) recording

MS recordings need to be "matrixed" or "decoded" into a loudspeaker format.

For a stereo format:

- Omnidirectional channel is panned center
- Bidirectional is added to L
- Bidirectional is added **and inverted** to R

```
L = left speaker
R = right speaker
O = omnidirectional signal
B = bidirectional signal

L = O + B
R = O - B
```

You can artificially "widen" a signal by applying a positive coefficient on the bidirectional signal.
