# Threshold (DRP)

In [[dynamic-range-processing|DRP]], the **threshold** of a DRP determines the level (or [[amplitude]]) at which the effect is applied onto an [[audio-signal|audio signal]].

In some effects, DRP is applied when a signal falls _below_ the threshold:

- [[noise-gate|noise gates]]
- downward [[expander|expansion]]
- upward [[compression]]

In other effects, DRP is applied when signals rise _above_ the threshold:

- downward [[compression]]
- upward [[expander|expansion]]
- [[limiter|limiting]]
