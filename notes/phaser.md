# Phaser

A **phaser** effect is a [[variable-delay-effects|variable delay effect]] (also known as _phase-shifting_ or _phasing_) where an [[audio-signal]] is fed through a series of [[all-pass-filter]]s, introducing a [[frequency]]-specific [[phase]] shift.

- [[oscillator]] modulates amount of phase-shift
- sweeping peaks and nulls appear in [[spectrum]], related to number of all-pass filter "stages"
- width and depth of peaks/nulls can be varied by changing all-pass filter parameters
- introduces a "spectral sweep" that colors the sound

The resulting sound is similar to the [[flanger]]

- flanging → variable-delay [[comb-filter]]
- phasing → variable-delay [[all-pass-filter]]
