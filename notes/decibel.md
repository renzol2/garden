# Decibel

A **decibel** is a logarithmic unit for describing power and intensity, providing a more concise, convenient and meaningful range of numbers

- abbreviated **dB**, 1/10th of a bel, named after [[alexander-graham-bell|Alexander Graham Bell]]

The decibel is _always_ a relative measurement, either comparing two quantities of comparing one quantity to an implied reference value. This value always depends on **_context_**.

- threshold of perception = +-1 dB
- doubling/halving [[sound-waves|sound]] power = +- 3 dB
- doubling/halving distance from a sound source = += 6 dB
  - also when you cut the [[amplitude]] in half (or double the height of amplitude)

Decibels are used on a variety of [[decibel-scales|scales]], depending on the context.
