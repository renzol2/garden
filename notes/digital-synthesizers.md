# Digital Synthesizers

An **digital synthesizer** is a [[synthesizer]] device used to [[sound-synthesis|synthesize sound]] digitally using [[digital-signal-processing|digital signal processing]].

## History

### Digital Improvements

Tools for digital control and programmability became commercially viable and available ca. mid-1970s.

This enabled the _ability to recall configurations_, among other enhancements, such as "hybrid" [[analog-synthesizers|analog]]/digital synthesizers:

- GROOVE - Max Mathews @ Bell Labs, late 1960s
  - (Generated Real-Time Output Operations on Voltage-Controlled Equipment)
  - system for interactive [[music-composition|music composition]]
  - see: DDP-24 computer card rack used in GROOVE system
- Buchla 500 Series ca. 1970
- Synclavier, developed by Jon Appleton et al. at Dartmouth University

**[[midi|MIDI]]** (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)

- digital [[communication-protocol|communication protocol]] for computers and musical instruments, developed and released in 1983
- quickly and fully embraced by the synthesizer industry

Numerous MIDI synthesizers saw commercial success:

- Yamaha DX7, DX11, Kurzweil K2000

### Computers and Software

PC Proliferation (ca. late 1980s) has migrated synthesizer development to a software platform

- the need for real-time performance capabilities with digital synthesis on computers required new methods to generate sound efficiently in terms of memory and processing speed
- led to the conception of [[wavetable-synthesis]], a fast and memory-inexpensive synthesis method

Examples of digital software synthesizers:

- _Massive_, Native-Instruments modular synthesizer plugin
- _Serum_, Xfer Records modular synthesizer plugin
- _Max/MSP_, visual programming language for audio/visual artists by Cycling '74
