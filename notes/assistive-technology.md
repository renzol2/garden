# Assistive technology

Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (amended in 2004)

- any item, piece of equipment or product system whether acquired commercially, off the shelf, modified, or customized that is used to increase, maintain, or improve _functional capabilities_ of individuals with disabilities

Terms with definition

- Functional capabilities
  - Performance of necessary roles in society
    - work
    - Home life
  - The only real measure of success of an AT device
- Individuals with disabilities
  - Emphasis on the individual
  - Each situation is a unique circumstance

## Types of Assistive Technologies

### Low Tech

- Non-complex equipment
- Example: universal cuff to facilitate eating

### High tech

- Complex equipment
- Example: voice activated computer

### Hard tech

- readily available tangible components that can be purchased and assembled
- example: mouth sticks, computers, software

### Soft tech

- Human areas of decision making, strategies, training, and concept formation
- example: training to use a power wheelchair

## Appliance vs. Tools

**Appliance** - provides benefits to an individual independent of the individual's skill level

**Tool** - requires some degree of skill to operate

AT examples

- Appliance - eyeglasses, splints, and seating system not dependent on skill of user
- Tool - maneuvering a powered wheelchair
  - Successful use of an AT tool may require training, strategies, or special skills (soft tech)

## Minimal vs. maximal technologies

- Minimal tech - generally augments rather than replaces function
  - Example: ankle foot orthotic (AFO)
- Maximal tech - generally replaces a body part or function
  - **Upper extremity prosthesis** replaces the function of the upper extremity to aid in performance of activities of daily living
  - **Speech generating device** replaces function of speech
