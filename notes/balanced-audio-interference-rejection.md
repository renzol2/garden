# Balanced Audio Interference Rejection

**Balanced Audio Interference Rejection** is a characteristic of [[balanced-audio|balanced audio]]. Balanced audio rejects signal interference, even over long distances, through the following method:

1. [[audio-signal|Signal]] is transmitted on hot wire, inverted copy transmitted on cold wire
2. Signals pick up unwanted interference along the way; [[noise]] pattern is essentially identical one each signal since wires occupy nearly the same space
3. Summing these signals and reducing the [[amplitude]] by half reveals the interference signal
4. Original signal is summed with inverted interference signal, nullifying interference
