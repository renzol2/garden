# Ratio (DRP)

In [[dynamic-range-processing|dynamic range processing]], the **ratio** is the severity of signal attenuation or gain that is applied when a [[audio-signal|signal]] passes the threshold of the effect.

- Represents change in input signal ([[decibel|dB]]) compared to change in output signal (dB)

e.g. [[compression]] ratio of 4:1

- above threshold, if input signal increases by 4 dB, output signal is attenuated so that the increase is only 1 dB
