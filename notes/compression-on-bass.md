# Compression on Bass

Below are some notes on using [[compression]] on (electric) bass.

From [BlackGhostAudio](https://www.blackghostaudio.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-compression):

- the goal is always a _smooth, level_ bassline
- achievable through both downward and [[upward-compression|upward]] compression
  - OTT, Bass Rider by Waves, etc.
- however, avoid _over-compression_
  - results in lost integrity, no life or power in the low end

See: [[compressing-for-a-reason#Electric Bass]]:

- In rock, bass should provide **strong, consistent** low [[frequency|frequency]] foundation
- Less peak sensitive, lengthen attack time to keep rhythmic energy of bass
- Automate fills when bass does fills in higher registers
