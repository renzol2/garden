TODO: flesh this out

**Ambisonics** is a full-sphere surround-[[sound-waves|sound]] format.

Emerged in the early 70s by Michael Gerzon in the UK

## History

True beginning in the early 1930s with the advent of stereophonic sound and the mid-side technique

Early 70s - push to make quadraphonic sound a commercial phenomenon, but it never took off as much

- at this time, Gerzon and his colleagues worked on early ambisonic developments
- Gerzon actually disapproved of quadraphonic sound, since he claimed it didn't produce a significant improvement from stereophonic 

## Ingredients

- Ambisonic order
- Component ordering
- Component normalization
- Reference radius

Ambisonic order and component ordering is more important.

Component normalization and reference radius are less vital.
