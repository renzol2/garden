# Spectrum

A **spectrum** is a description of frequencies and amplitudes of all [[partial]]s in a signal.

## Sound

A **sound spectrum** is a representation of [[sound-waves|sound]] in terms of [[frequency]].

- usually presented as a 2-D graph of power or pressure (ex. [[decibel]]s) as a function of frequency
- displays the intensity of each frequency, usually within the human audible spectrum of 20Hz - 20kHz

Almost all sounds are _complex_ vibrations; they can be periodic, but most are not simply [[sine-wave|sinusoidal]].

In some contexts, spectra can be considered _harmonic_ or _[[inharmonicity|inharmonic]]_:

- **harmonic spectrum:** only harmonic partials are present
- **inharmonic spectrum:** at least one inharmonic partial is present
