# HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)

> **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** is an extension of the [[hypertext-transfer-protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the [[Internet]]. In HTTPS, the [[communication-protocol|communication protocol]] is encrypted using [[transport-layer-security|Transport Layer Security (TLS)]] or, formerly, [[secure-sockets-layer|Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)]]. The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. - Wikipedia
