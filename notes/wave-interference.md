# Wave Interference

By the [[linear-superposition|principle of linear superposition]], all waves (including [[sound-waves|sound waves]]) experience interference.

## Constructive interference

Two compressions sum to create a greater compression.

Two rarefactions sum to create a greater rarefaction.

## Destructive interference

A compression & rarefaction partially or completely cancel each other

Pressure at a point where multiple sound waves exist equals the sum of pressures of individual waves at that point.

`pressure A + pressure B = pressure A + B`

What you perceive (hear) is the sum of all the sound waves reaching your ear. Our brain can parse that information and identify sources.

- A [[microphones|microphone]], however, can only perceive a single volume
- Linear superposition explains why we can perceive multiple notes, instruments, waves, etc. even when audio files only exhibit one pressure measurement per sample
