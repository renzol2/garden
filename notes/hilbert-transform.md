# Hilbert Transform

A **Hilbert Transform** is an operation on a wave or signal that imparts a phase shift of $\pm90\degree$ to every frequency component of a function.

## Audio Signal Processing

Within [[audio-signal|audio signal]] processing, the Hilbert Transform moves the [[phase]] of any [[waveform]] by $\pm90\degree$. This may or may not have any audible changes.

Example: A Hilbert Transformed Square Wave is a [[square-wave|square wave]] made of cosine components (+90 degrees), rather than [[sine-wave|sine]] components. However, despite the change in appearance, they generally sound the same.
