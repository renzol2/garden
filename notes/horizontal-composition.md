# Horizontal composition

Horizontal composition is a framework for [[music-composition|music composition]] that focuses on the melodic contours and _horizontal relationships_ between notes rather than the harmonic, _vertical_ relationships.

- unlike vertical composition, you can validate any note in any chord by way of its place in the melody
- no such thing as "right" and "wrong" notes
- rather: "there are strong decisions and there are weak decisions" (Jacob Collier)

Each note has a consequence or context in its melody.

- a note may sound weird in its vertical chord, but horizontally it should make sense within its melody

Horizontal composition opens the door towards different possibilities for improvisation and composition.
