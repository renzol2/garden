# Sidechain compression

**Sidechain compression** is a [[compression]] technique involving [[side-chaining]], i.e. the input of one [[audio-signal|signal]] is used to affect the output of a different signal

- sometimes called "ducking" or "pumping"
- target signal "ducks" out of the way when the source signal passes the [[threshold-drp|threshold]]
- often in [[pop-music|pop]] and EDM: bass, chords, etc. will duck for the [[kick]]
