# Buss compression

**Buss compression** refers to [[compression]] applied to a [[buss]].

- the goal is often to "glue" individual [[audio-signal|signals]] of the buss together
- usually gentle compression with a [[ratio-drp|ratio]] of 2:1
- mild decrease in the [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] of a buss results in a subtle sense of the elements being perceived as sharing the same space
