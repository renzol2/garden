# Language of disability

[[disability-studies|Disability studies]] has common terminology associated with [[disability]]

- All disciplines have their own language
- Language of disability was built around misinformation and cruel intentions
- Continued use may misconvey information or reinforce cruel terminology
  - ex. "The patient is wheelchair bound" vs. "This client is a full-time wheelchair user"

## Person-first language

[[person-first-language|Person-first language]] is a type of language usage where the emphasis is on the person rather than their disability

- ex. "Person with [[spinal-cord-injury|spinal cord injury]]" vs. "Paraplegic"
- There exists many philosophies on appropriate language

## Stereotypes of people with disabilities

- **Stereotype** - a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a person or thing
  - Stereotypes are ideas that are commonly enforced
- What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of a disabled person?
- reconceptions about the actions and preferences of people with disabilities are very common
- Influences from the media, behaviors of others, and laws shape our thinking

## Labeling of people with disabilities

Labeling involves the categorization of people based on their impairment

- necessary for government funding and administrative decision making
- helps healthcare professionals and researchers to determine who their findings can be applied to
- spotlight issues and causes for the general public
  - increase awareness and funding for a particular disability
- people with disabilities often "live up" to their label
  - ex. employment is often a challenge for individuals with disabilities

## Stigma

- Extreme form of labeling
- "Characteristic of a person who is reduced in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one" (Goffman, 1963)
- Frequently becomes a permanent description of the person
  - "All people with cerebral palsy can't walk"
  - Not true - there are many functional parameters that factor into whether a person with [[cerebral-palsy|cerebral palsy]] can walk or not

## Self-determination

A self-determined person is someone who determines their own fate or course of action without compulsion

- What are some contexts/situations where control is taken away from you?

Self determination doesn't have to mean total independence, just having control; in our complex society, we rely on others to do things for us

- Car repair
- Surgical procedures

## Self-determination and severe disability

- self-regulate
- self-manage behaviors
- become less dependent on others
- express preferences and use those preferences to make choices
