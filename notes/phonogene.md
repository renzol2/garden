# Phonogène

The **Phonogène** is an early [[sampling-composition|sampling]] instrument invented by [[pierre-schaeffer|Pierre Schaeffer]] in Paris in the 1950s.

- mini [[tape]] players, like a keyboard for sampling

The phonogène consists of twelve tape capstans of differing diameters. A key press engages on capstone and moves a tape loop across a playhead at a specific rate corresponding to the [[pitch]] of the key being pressed.
