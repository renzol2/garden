# Kulintang Notation

Traditionally, [[kulintang]] music was never notated. It was often, and still is, taught and passed down orally. Besides, most of kulintang music is improvised.

It wasn't until kulintang was brought into academia and universities that there arose a need for notation.

Kulintang master Aga Mayo Butocan devised a system of cipher notation for kulintang music.

## Cipher Notation

This is a type of cipher notation. The numbers do not correspond to any specific [[pitch]], but rather, the gong numbers.

The numbers on the top row are for the right hand; the bottom row is for the left hand.

_Note_: the notation style and layout in this book is not the only standard style of notating kulintang music; there are several other notation styles that exist

## Western and Cipher notation hybrids

This style combines traditional staved Western notation with the cipher numbers for each gong, which is better if the composer wants to better visualize the pitches used.

This style forgoes the staff but keeps the cipher numbers, and is closer to the original kulintang cipher notation. The performer can easily see which notes should be played on the left and right hand.

## Common Practices

### Pitches

Composers should specify the desired pitches or [[kulintang-tuning|tuning]] of each gong at the beginning of the piece.

- common practice for other traditional Asian instruments when notation with Western score

### Improvisation

This example maximizes the improvisatory nature of the kulintang. The composer simply notates that the performer may improvise freely on the binalig pattern, a common [[maguindanao|Maguindanaon]] rhythmic mode.

- this requires clear communication between [[music-composition|composer]] and performer to achieve maximum accuracy
- in general, composers and performers should communicate before writing to achieve best results
