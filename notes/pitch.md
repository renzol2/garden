# Pitch

**Pitch** is the subjective human response to [[frequency]].

- characteristic by which tones are ordered from low to high

## Perception

It is _culturally_ related to frequency, but

- frequency is quantifiable and observable - number of cycles per second
- pitch is simply our subjective perception of frequency
- pitch can be ambiguous
- the same frequencies can be different between different backgrounds and even situational contexts

We might "hear" some infrasonic frequencies, but we do not perceive their pitch

- instead, we perceive a regular rhythmic pattern
- phenomenon of [[psychoacoustics]]

## Description

In Western notation, pitch is often notated within the [[tet|twelve equal temperament system]].

- each individual pitch falls within one of 12 [[pitch-class|pitch classes]] and some octave
- also commonly used with [[midi|MIDI]], equating certain key number values to pitch
