# Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a set of elementary instructions.

- algorithms are explicit, precise, unambiguous
- usually, mechanically-executable
- usually intended to accomplish a specific purpose

Algorithms have been with us since the dawn of civilization, but have become a topic of formal academic study only within the past few decades

- descriptions of step-by-step arithmetic as early examples of written human language

## Describing Algorithms

A complete description of any algorithm has four components:

1. **What**: a precise specification of the problem that the algorithm solves
2. **How**: a precise description of the algorithm itself
3. **Why**: a proof that the algorithm solves the problem it is supposed to solve
4. **How fast**: an analysis of the [[runtime]] of the algorithm

It is not necessary to develop these four components in this particular order.

- specifications, descriptions, correctness, and analyses evolve simultaneously or are iterated on separately
- _presenting_ these components separately is usually clearest for the reader

Aim your descriptions at the right audience: ex. a competent but skeptical programmer _who is not as clever as you are_

- over time, you naturally build up lots of intuition about the problem
- anyone _reading_ the algorithm later, or the derived code, will not share that intuition or experience

TODO: take more notes
