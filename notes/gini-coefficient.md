# Gini coefficient

The **Gini coefficient** is one of the most commonly used measurements of [[income-inequality|income inequality]] that looks at the share of aggregate income held by each individual.

- in a perfectly equal world, everyone has the same income/same share of aggregate income (Gini coefficient = 0.0)
- in a perfectly _unequal_ world, one individual holds all aggregate income (Gini coefficient = 1.0)

The Gini coefficient ranges from around 0.25 in some countries in eastern and northern Europe to 0.60 countries in southern Africa ([Income Inequality in the U.S. Is Rising Most Rapidly Among Asians (Pew Research Center)](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/))

Alternatives to the Gini coefficient for measuring income inequality:

- Theil index
- Atkinson index
- measurements of consumption or wealth, ex. consumption inequality and wealth inequality
- inequality in economic opportunity, i.e. access to schooling or jobs (more recent)
