# 10 music production tricks (learnt from Au5)

TL;DR:

1. 4.5db per octave
2. [[spectrogram]] hidden image
3. mastering automation
4. removing [[fundamental]] 
5. bass modulation transients
6. de-phased saw wave
7. corpus for texture
8. quanta noise
9. staccato after legato
10. workflow

## 4.5 db per octave

- for dubstep drops, a 4.5 [[decibel|db]] per octave slope results in a perceptively balanced [[spectrum]]
  - a noise at -4.5 db per octave has a [[spectrum]] between pink [[noise]] and brown noise
- safe target to minimize extreme peaks or troughs to account for many listening environments
- only for a section of music that requires full [[frequency]] representation

## spectrogram hidden image

- not really useful, but this link is cool: <https://nsspot.herokuapp.com/imagetoaudio/>

## mastering automation

- use a knob that shelves down lows and highs and narrows the stereo image on parts of a track that has tension building
- makes drops feel punctual once the knob goes back to default
- on non-EDM genres, ride the gain on [[limiter]] input gain rather than output gain to keep full [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] (not a huge deal in EDM)

## remove fundamental

- for making supersaws or layered [[synthesizer|synth]] sounds with detuning or phasing effects, remove the [[fundamental]] of the detuned [[sawtooth-wave|saw]] and replace the fundamental with a strong, consistent tone (e.g. [[sine-wave|sine wave]])

## bass modulation transient

- in drops with percussive bass modulation, add a click [[transient]] (ex. white [[noise]] click with [[amplitude]] [[envelope]]) to the start of each modulation to accentuate movement

## dephased saw

- [[sawtooth-wave|saw]] where [[harmonic|harmonics]] have random [[phase]]

## corpus for texture

- use ableton corpus or objeq delay to add [[resonance]] to [[sound-waves|sounds]]
- basically, use physical modeling for interesting textures

## quanta noise

make "quanta noise" and add to percussion

- "random noise, but quantized"
- example implementation: use white noise with a vocoder

## staccato after legato

- songwriting tip: have a staccato bass drop section after a legato section

## workflow

- have creative sound design sections to make a "sample pack" of sorts for future you
- separate creative, experimental workflows from arranging, songwriting workflows
