# Triangle wave

A **triangle wave** is a [[waveform]] exhibiting periods of increasing and decreasing slopes, switching between positive and negative slopes at peak [[amplitude]].

The [[spectrum]] of a triangle wave consists of only odd [[harmonic]]s in the [[harmonic-series|harmonic series]].

- [[amplitude]] of the $n$th harmonic = $\frac{1}{n^2}$.
- harmonics 3, 7, 11, etc. are 180 degrees out of [[phase]]
