# Mellotron

The **Mellotron** is an early [[sampling-composition|sampling]] instrument invented in Birmingham, England in 1963.

It evolved from the Chamberlin and improved that design to facilitate mass production.

It consists of a polyphonic tape-replay keyboard, which uses motorized tape rollers that pinch the tape and runs it across a playhead when a key is pressed.
