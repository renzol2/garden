## Kulintang

In the study of [[kulintang]] and [[palabunibunyan]], the **nuclear melody** is a set of tones played in a melodic-rhythmic pattern which is repeated and transposed up and down the kulintang.

- introduced by [[philippines|Philippine]] ethnomusicologist Jose Maceda

A kulintang performance is described by Maceda in this way:

> ...playing a melodic-rhythmic pattern based on a certain group of gongs - two, three or four tongs - repeating the pattern a few times before shifting progressively, e.g. from the third, fourth and fifth gongs as one group to the fourth, fifth and sixth gongs as another group, and to the fifth, sixth, and seventh gongs as still another group, etc..... Many kulintang improvisations run in the manner described, and there are other varieties... but they generally center on the idea of a nuclear unit of gongs as a basis of a melodic phrase, and one by which form, improvisation, and gong permutations can be explained.... (Maceda 1963 vol. 1: 72-73)
