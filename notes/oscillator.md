# Oscillator

An **oscillator** is any unit capable of generating signals (typically [[audio-signal|audio signals]], but sometimes signals at lower [[frequency|frequencies]]) for use in [[sound-synthesis|sound synthesis]]. They are the workhorse of [[additive-synthesis|additive synthesis]].

- usually a unit within a [[synthesizer]]
- typically has some [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]] input, as well as the type of [[waveform]] it produces
- sometimes called VCOs (voltage controlled oscillators)
  - term originating from [[analog-synthesizers|analog synthesizers]], where [[electrical-current|electric voltage]] determined oscillator parameters

Oscillators operate under some form of synthesis to generate sound

- ex. [[wavetable-synthesis|wavetable synthesis]]
