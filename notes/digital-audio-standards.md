# Digital Audio Standards

**Digital Audio Standards** are a set of specifications that standardize the [[digital-audio|digital audio]] industry.

The compact disc stores 16-[[bit]] audio at a [[sample-rate|sample rate]] of 44100 [[sampling-signal-processing|samples]] per second.

- [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] = 96 dB, N = 22050

Many professional studios work with 24- or 32-bit audio at 192000 samples per second

- dynamic range = 144/192 dB, N = 96000

Higher sample rates/bit depths consume significantly more memory. Are the higher specs worth it?

- Debatable, considering that pro-quality audio is often downsampled to 44.1/16 for physical media production/mass distribution
- Consumer listening often occurs in sub-ideal listening environments, with consumer-grade equipment, etc.
