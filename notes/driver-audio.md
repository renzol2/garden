# Driver (audio)

A **driver** in [[audio-hardware|audio hardware]] comprises of the permanent magnet voice coil and speaker cone used in dynamic [[loudspeakers]] and headphones.

Most loudspeakers have multiple drivers:

- single driver cannot radiate full audible [[spectrum]] with equal efficiency
- multiple drivers used for specific [[frequency]] ranges
- possible through [[crossover]] circuitry

**Two-way speakers:**

- tweeter (high frequencies)
- woofer (low frequencies)

**Three-way speaker:**

- tweeter, mid-range, woofer

**Subwoofer:** standalone driver for efficient reproduction of low and infrasonic frequencies

- Good for ~30 Hz to hear _and feel_ the waves
