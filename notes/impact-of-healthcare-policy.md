# Impact of healthcare policy

Healthcare policy and [[disability]] is a recent area of focus for disability rights advocates.

Some conflicts

- people with disabilities utilize healthcare more frequently vs. general population
- Aversion to the "medical" aspects of disability and the delivery of healthcare services

People with disabilities largely ignored the issue until the 1990s. Lack of involvement:

- rejected the assumption of the "sick role" and the [[medical-model|medical model]]
- Felt that the healthcare system devalued people with disabilities
- When needed, people typically received th necessary care
- Disability advocates became more engaged as funding of healthcare began to change

## Opposition to health care laws

1992 - Oregon asked to reallocate Medicaid dollars to focus on a list of preferred conditions and treatments

- People with disabilities felt they were excluded and discriminated against
- Continued to fight healthcare changes made during the 1990s
- Particularly opposed to managed care plans

### Managed Care and Disability

- A way that health plans and providers organize and manage the delivery of health services in a more coordinated fashion, often at a fixed price
- Capitation of payments - only pay a certain amount of money for a given condition or impairment
- Gatekeepers - must see a primary care physician prior to having access to a specialist

### Impact of Managed Care

- Prefer to enroll healthier people to reduce costs - "creaming"
- Difficult to enroll in plans due to "preexisting" conditions
  - Preexisting condition - "medical condition that occurred before a program of health benefits goes into effect"

## Impact of the Affordable Care Act

- Expands financial eligibility for Medicaid
- Health insurance companies cannot deny coverage for people with preexisting conditions
- Prohibits discrimination based on disability
- No annual caps on benefits
- Expands home and community based services for people with disabilities (Money Follows the Person)
