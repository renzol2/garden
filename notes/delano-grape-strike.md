# Delano Grape Strike

The **Delano Grape Strike** was a labor strike organized by the AWOC (Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee), a predominantly Filipino organization, against table grape growers in Delano, California to fight against labor exploitation. The NFWA (National Farmworkers Association), comprised of predominantly Mexican workers, joined a week after the start of the strike on September 8, 1965.

- AWOC and NWFA joined together in 1966 to become the _United Farm Workers_ (UFW) Organizing Committee
- AWOC was organized primarily by Filipino-American activist [[larry-itliong|Larry Itliong]]

The strike resulted in victory for the farm workers in 1970, as a collective bargaining agreement over workers' rights and conditions was reached between major table grape growers, which affected more than 10,000 workers.

## Significance

The Delano Grape Strike was notable for multiple things:

- effective implementation and adaptation of boycotts
- solidarity between Filipino and Mexican farm workers to unionize farm labor
- resulting creation of the UFW
