# Complex number

A **complex number** is a number with a _real_ and _imaginary_ component.

This can be described in several ways, like:

$$
x = a + bj = re^{j \theta}
$$

where $a$ is the real part, $b$ is the imaginary part, and $j$ is $\sqrt{-1}$.

Imaginary numbers can be plotted on a polar graph where the x-direction is the real component, the y-direction is the imaginary component, $r$ is the magnitude from $(0, 0)$, and $\theta$ is the angle between the x-axis and the vector.

## Magnitude of a complex number vector

$$
r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

The _square magnitude_ is just $r^2$.

## Conjugate of a complex number

The _conjugate_ of a complex number is the same number with the imaginary component having its sign switched:

$$
x^* = a - bj = re^{-j \theta}
$$
