# Frequency Modulation

In **frequency modulation** (FM), the [[frequency]] of a _carrier_ [[audio-signal|signal]] is altered by a _modulator_ signal.

Deviations of the carrier causes spectral "sidebands" (additional frequencies) at multiples of the modulator above and below the carrier frequency.

## The C:M Ratio

The **carrier to modulator ratio (C:M)** determines the harmonicity of the resulting [[spectrum]]

- for [[harmonic-series|harmonic]] spectra, $M$ must have an integer relationship to $C$
- Non integer ratios produce [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] spectra

## Composing with FM

In [[spectral-composition|spectral composition]], FM is a powerful [[algorithm]] for generating spectral note sets!

- can generate inharmonic (dissonant) or [[harmonic-series|harmonic]] (consonant) sets
