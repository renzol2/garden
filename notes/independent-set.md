# Independent Set

Let $G$ be a simple, unweighted, undirected graph. An **independent set** in $G$ is a subset of the vertices of $G$ with _no edges_ between them.

The _maximum independent set_ (`MaxIndSet`) asks for the size of the largest independent set in a given graph. `MaxIndset` is in NP-hard ([[p-vs-np]]).
