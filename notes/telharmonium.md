# Telharmonium

Active from 1897-1914

- invented by Thaddeus Cahill, American inventor/lawyer
- First true electronic music [[synthesizer]]
- Six octave polyphony, touch sensitive, some [[timbre]] control

## Timeline

- 1897: patent acquired
- 1900: Washington DC: first prototype and demonstration; sponsors acquired
- 1902: lab established at Holyoke, MA; first proper Telharmonium constructed; NY/New England Electric Music Company established
- 1904: Cahill Telharmonium Co. established
- 1906: "Telharmonic Hall" on 39th and Broadway, NYC; numerous public concerts/transmissions
- 1907: legal/infrastructure complications
- 1908: public transmissions slow and gradually cease
- 1910: sponsor support wanes. Telharmonic Hall closes
- 1911-12: third Telharmonium constructed with several improvements, final debut stream to Carnegie Hall
- 1914: Cahill Telharmonium Co. declares bankruptcy

## Specs

- only three Telharmoniums ever constructed
- 60-foot mainframe
- 10 switchboard panels, 2,000 switches
- 145 rheotomes ('tone wheels' acting as alternators)
- appearance of a power generator station
- 200-ton weight
- $200,000 value, $5 million value

## Operating principles

- twelve rotating shafts, one for each chromatic [[pitch]]
- several cogged 'tonewheels' on each shaft for [[fundamental]] and [[overtone|overtones]]
- shafts driven by one belt, preventing tuning drift
- cog wheels as alternators, producing [[alternating-current|AC]] by periodically completing circuits

## Decline

- expensive: $1M spent from 1897-1914 (not inflation-adjusted)
- rapidly obsoleted by technological advancements:
  - wireless radio transmissions
  - [[vacuum-tube|vacuum tube]] amplifiers
- infrastructure challenges: disruption/interference with existing telephone lines
- Telharmonium parts eventually sold for scrap
