# Proximity effect

The **proximity effect** is an acoustic phenomenon of increased low [[frequency-response|frequency response]] when the [[sound-waves|sound]] source is within ~2 feet of a directional [[microphones|microphone]].

- Severity of effect increases with microphone directionality, depending on the [[polar-pattern|polar pattern]]
  - strongest in [[bidirectional]] mics, present in [[cardioid]], absent in [[omnidirectional]]
- Exploited for dramatic effect
  - think: close-mic singing (Billie Eillish)

Microphones often have a low [[frequency]] rolloff switch to counteract proximity effect.
