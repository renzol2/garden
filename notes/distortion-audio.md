# Distortion (audio)

**Distortion** is an [[audio-signal|audio signal]] processing effect that alters the original shape of a signal. It is generally considered an artifact that is unwanted in many cases, but also wanted and even intentional in other cases, especially in music.

Musically, it can induce a "fuzzy", "growling", or "gritty" tone, caused by distorting signals through various means.

Distortion effects affect signals in various ways:

- clipping the signal
- adds sustain
- adds [[harmonic|harmonics]] and [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] overtones
- [[compression|compresses the dynamic range]], in a way that sounds "warm" and "dirty"
