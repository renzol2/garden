# World Wide Web

The **world wide web** is an information network on the [[internet]]. Information is shared in the form of documents (in formats like [[hypertext-markup-language|HTML]]) and other resources.

While the [[internet]] is the technological network, the web is the cultural network/practice of sharing information across the internet.
