# Sawtooth wave

A **sawtooth wave** is a [[waveform]] exhibiting periods with a ramp down (or up) followed by an immediate jump back up (or down).

The [[spectrum]] of a sawtooth wave consists of all [[harmonic]]s in the [[harmonic-series|harmonic series]]. The [[amplitude]] of the $n$th harmonic can be given as $\frac{1}{n}$.
