# Fletcher-Munson Curve

The Fletcher-Munson curve, also referred to as equal-loudness curves, describes the way the human ear perceives [[loudness]] at different [[frequency|frequencies]] across the [[spectrum|frequency spectrum]].

- essentially, this curve is a function of frequency (in Hz) to loudness (in SPL)
- important in the study of [[psychoacoustics]]

At a high level, it describes the following phenomena:

- at lower volumes, we hear mid range frequencies louder
- at higher volumes, we hear low and high frequencies louder

Some high level tips for mixing with the Fletcher-Munson curve in mind:

- the "smiley face" [[equalization|EQ]] curve (increase low and high end, reduce mids) results in higher perceived loudness as it compensates for low volume playback, and sounds especially loud at high volumes
  - also removes mid-range "boxiness" from certain instruments, which could psychoacoustically increase perceived loudness of low end
  - example: smiley face EQ in combination with medium-long attack time [[compression]] can increase the power of a kick drum
- when mixing quietly, low end should be present enough
- when mixing loudly, keep mid-range in mind and lower if necessary
