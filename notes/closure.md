# Closure

A **closure** is a pair of an [[environment-programming|environment]] and an association of a sequence of variables (the input variables) with an expression (the function body), written:

$$
f \rightarrow < (v_1, ..., n) \rightarrow \text{exp}, \rho_f>
$$

where $\rho_f$ is the environment in effect when $f$ is defined (if $f$ is a simple function)

Note: the function always has a _single_ variable
