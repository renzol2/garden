# Zettelkasten

**Zettelkasten** is a form of note-taking that focuses on forming connections between new and old ideas to easily form new ideas and increase productivity.

- rough translation: notes in a box

The notes themselves should be atomic and focusing on a singular idea. Tags are associated with each note. These tags help form connections between notes, whether old or new, to help solidify information in the mind and recall old information.

**Take notes on the go**, and transfer them to the knowledge base during downtime.
