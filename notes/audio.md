# Audio

**Audio** is a broad subject that covers many technologies:

- Physical audio technologies
- Electrical/[[analog-audio|analog audio]] technologies: analog transmission and storage, analog manipulation
- [[digital-audio|Digital audio]] technologies: [[sound-synthesis|synthesis]], analysis, compression, streaming

Audio and acoustics engineers make audio technologies that we all use everyday.

## History

Long time ago:

- Pythagoras (music) was the first to do "serious" work on music and sound
- Vitruvius (architectural acoustics): hypothesized that [[sound-waves|sound]] works as a 3-dimensional [[waveform|wave]]
  - Made the first acoustic [[equalization|equalizers]] for sound

Some time ago:

- Gallileo ([[psychoacoustics]]): worked on how we perceive sound
- Mersenne (speed of sound)

A little later:

- Helmholtz (physiology)
- Raleigh (_Theory of Sound_)

The electrical age:

- Ohm, Wheatstone (electricity / acoustics connection)

Phone and radio

- Bell, Marconi

Recording

- Edison ([[phonograph]]), Berliner ([[gramophone]])

Modern audio technologies

- [[tape|Tape]] machines, recording studios
  - Walkman, multi track tape recording
- Digital audio devices
  - iPods, MP3 players, audio recorders, hearing aids
- Telephony and speech technology
  - Cell phones, speech recognition, speech synthesis
  - Smart speakers

Use of audio technologies today

- Entertainment
  - Radio, TV, music playback, [[sound-synthesis]]
- Medicine and biology
  - Ultrasound, hearing aids for [[hearing-impairments|hearing impairments]], bioacoustics
- Monitoring
  - Ocean mapping, [[noise]] measuring, surveillance
- Acoustic optimization
  - Quieter cars, planes, boats with noise cancellation
  - Better rooms
