# Transient

A **transient** in sound and music is a moment where the [[amplitude]] changes drastically, conventionally in a large upward change.

- used synonymously with "attack"
- associated with percussion and drums, ex. [[kick]] drums

In an [[envelope]], the transient is the envelope region during which amplitude is changing.
