# Modulation Synthesis

**Modulation synthesis** is a form of [[sound-synthesis|sound synthesis]] where the output of some [[oscillator]] is used to control (or _modulate_) input parameters for another [[oscillator]].

- in examples, [[sine-wave|sine waves]] often control these parameters
- in practice, any waves can be used

Types of modulation synthesis:

- [[amplitude-modulation|amplitude modulation]]
- [[frequency-modulation|frequency modulation]]
- [[ring-modulation|ring modulation]]

Modular synthesizers (both [[analog-synthesizers|analog]] and [[digital-synthesizers|digital]]) paved the way for modulation synthesis.

- modular design allowed connection of different modules
- some use in [[granular-synthesis|granular synthesis]] as well
