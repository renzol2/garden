# Linear Superposition

Unlike matter, waves can coexist in the same physical space and even pass through each other and retain essential characteristics.

**Principle of Linear Superposition:**

Waves can pass through one another while retaining their original characteristics:

`pressure A + pressure B = pressure A + B`

For [[sound-waves|sound waves]], this phenomenon causes [[wave-interference|interference]].
