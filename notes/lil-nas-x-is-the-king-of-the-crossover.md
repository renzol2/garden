# LIL NAS X IS THE KING OF THE CROSSOVER

Notes:

- Old Town Road spent 19 weeks #1 on Billboard
- The exclusion of Old Town Road from Billboard's country charts prompted Billy Ray Cyrus to remix the song, adding some vocal lines throughout and an additional verse
- Old Town Road symbolizes "rebellion against parochialism and consensus in fraying times"
- at the GRAMMYs 2020 performance, BTS, Young Thug, Diplo, Mason Ramsey, and Billy Ray Cyrus all performed alongside Lil Nas X
