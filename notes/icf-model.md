# ICF Model

The **International Classification of Functioning Disability And Health** (ICF) Model is a [[models-of-disability|model of disability]] that evolved from the [[social-model|social]] and [[medical-model|medical]] models.

- combination of the best aspects of the medical and social model
- framework based on [[nagi-disablement-model|Nagi disablement model]] (1969)

The ICF model is a universal, standardized framework for governments, providers and consumers

- multi-purpose classification intended for a wide range of uses in different sectors
- added environmental and personal factors

ICF model looks at the interaction between health conditions (disease, disorders, and injuries) and contextual factors (environmental and personal factors)

- interactive and dynamic rather than linear or static!

Disability involves dysfunction at one or more levels:

- body functions and structures (physiological functions of body systems & organs)
- activities (execution of a task)
- participation (involvement in a life situation)

## Important terms in the ICF Model

- Body functions and structures
  - physiological functions of body systems and anatamoical parts of the body

- Participation
  - Involvement in desired activities
- Environmental factors
  - The context (environment) in which the person lives their life
- Personal factors

## ICF Contributions

- Use of [[person-first-language|person first]] terminology and [[language-of-disability|positive language]]
- Focus on what a person can do in their environment ("real world" life situations)
- Places an emphasis on function - not condition or disease
- Participation is the ultimate goal!
