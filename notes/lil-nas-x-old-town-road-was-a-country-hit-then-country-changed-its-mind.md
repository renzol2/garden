# Lil Nas X’s ‘Old Town Road’ Was a Country Hit. Then Country Changed Its Mind

Notes:

- [[lil-nas-x-old-town-road|Old Town Road]] saw widespread popularity on TikTok
- “Hooky, short, and wildly loopable”
- “Genre-defying creation blends banjo strums and jaw-rattling bass, rural imagery and hip-hop signifiers”
- debuted on Billboard's cross-genre Hot 100, Hot Country Songs, and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs all at once
- Billboard quietly removed "Old Town Road" from Hot Country Songs and told the label Columbia Records that it was a mistake
  - according to an insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity
- Billboard decided that Old Town Road did not embrace enough modern country music elements in its musical composition to warrant a placement on the Billboard country charts
- Decision to remove Old Town Road reveals a complicated racial dynamic
- Music industry leans on old fashioned genre boundaries, which are tightly coupled with race
  - R&B chart was originally "race music"
  - Latin songs chart takes many genres and languages into one "ethnic umbrella"
- Streaming results in songs going viral before labels, radio programmers, and music industry folks can assign genres
- Billboard claims that race had no part in decision to remove "Old Town Road" from the country chart
- Lil Nas X listed Old Town Road as countr yon iTunes and SoundCloud
- Songs no longer need to be bound by industry labels and institutions (and therefore institutional systems and biases)
- Rap has already infiltrated its way into country
  - Jason Aldean "Dirt Road Anthem" (he really does rap(?) or talk?)
  - Sam Hunt singles
- Digital distribution company that works with country artists says that trap drums immediately lead to some genre other than country
  - same distributor went to Nashville to see what agencies, streaming services, record labels thought -- and they looked at Old Town Road as a gimmick
- Beyoncé tried to submit the Lemonade track "Daddy Lessons" to Grammy committee for country songs, but was shot down
  - Beyoncé is also on Columbia
- Music industry sees rock and pop and music by (and for) white people
  - Juice WORLD's _Death Race for Love_ is "textbook rock and roll" due to guitar usage
  - probably the most commercially successful rock album of 2019, but it won't be in any premier rock playlist dominated by white artists
  - Pop radio programmers also reluctant to play music by Black artists
- "What do we do with artists that blur genre lines when they're [artists] of color? ... No one else has that problem."
