# Additive Synthesis

Additive synthesis is the process of generating [[sound-waves|sound]] by adding together individual [[frequency]] components to create various [[spectrum|spectra]].

- refers to a family of waveform summation techniques to create specific [[timbre|timbres]], usually [[sine-wave|sine waves]] summed together
- one of many types of [[sound-synthesis|sound synthesis]] techniques

## History

Additive synthesis was used within early [[electroacoustic-music|electroacoustic music]] for creating complex spectra by summing individual sine waves at specific frequencies

- achieved through [[fourier-theorem|Fourier]] synthesis
- tedious process with 1950s equipment:
  - record up to four tones on [[multi-track-magnetic-recording|four-track recorder]]
  - use [[mixer]] to mix to monophonic signal and record to single track recorder
  - record sum back to four-track recorder, leaving three tracks to be overwritten
    Stockhausen's **Studie I** (1953) composed entirely from sine waves
