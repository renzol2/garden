# Shelving filter

A shelving filter aims to boost or cut a particular [[frequency]] region of an [[audio-signal|audio signal]].

- typically analagous to a [[low-pass-filter]] or [[high-pass-filter]], but instead of  supressesing all [[frequency|frequencies]] in a stopband, it merely attenuates them
- usually seen as a [[high-shelf|high shelf]] or [[low-shelf|low shelf]] filter
