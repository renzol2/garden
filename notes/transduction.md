# Transduction

**Transduction** is the conversion from one form of energy to another.

## Audio

Certain [[audio-hardware]] devices act as transducers:

- [[Microphones]] are **input transducers:** acoustic to electrical energy
- [[Loudspeakers]] are **output transducers:** electrical to acoustic energy

In this case, "electrical energy" refers to [[electrical-current]], while "acoustic energy" refers to [[sound-waves]]
