# Comb Filter

**Comb filters** are [[audio-signal|audio signal]] [[filter|filters]] that filter out [[noise]] into discrete [[frequency|frequencies]] and impose [[resonance]]. They are fundamental building blocks for audio effects.

There are two types of comb filters: [[feedforward-comb-filter|feedforward]] and [[feedback-comb-filter|feedback]].
