# CSRF token

A **CSRF token** (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a token given to each unique user session of a web application.

- usually of a large random value
- inserted within hidden parameters of HTML forms

These tokens prevent CSRF attacks, which force users to submit state-changing requests that could expose information or otherwise cause harmful actions.
