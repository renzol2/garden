# User Interface

A **user interface** is a mechanism that allows users to map their goals onto system behavior.

User interfaces affect several aspects of a tool/program:

- productivity
- safety
- satisfaction

User interfaces are the new bottleneck in computing. While user resources and system resources are sufficient, the _interface_ between the two pools of resources is the blocker.
