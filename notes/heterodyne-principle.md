# Heterodyne principle

The **Heterodyne principle** is a phenomenon that occurs when two [[frequency|frequencies]] are multiplied together, creating sum/difference tones.

Example usage in the [[theremin]]:

- two RF [[oscillator|oscillators]]: one variable, one fixed at ~300 kHz
  - antenna & grounded performer act as capacitor
  - proximity to antenna alters output voltage
  - think like condenser mics with the capacitor plates
  - two oscillators are multiplied together, producing two tones at sum/difference frequencies (called heterodynes, heterodyne frequencies)
  - frequency of difference tone is within audible [[spectrum]]
