# Phase

**Phase** refers to a specific point within one cycle of a periodic wave.

- the initial phase of a periodic [[waveform]] has essentially no effect on our perception of such a wave, including [[sound-waves|sound waves]]
  - however, multiple sound waves can result in [[beating]]
- one cycle = 360 degrees = 2Ï€ radians
