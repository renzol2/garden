# Gain Staging

Gain staging is the process of managing [[audio-signal|audio signal]] levels:

- in recording and playback, to ensure that recording and monitoring levels are safe, healthy, and void of any issues
  - adhering to [[audio-level-standards]]
- in mixing and production, to ensure that
  - the mix is balanced levels-wise
  - each effect applied preserves the same level pre- and post-effect for the most objective A/B comparisons
