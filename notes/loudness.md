# Loudness

**Loudness** is a subjective perception of [[sound-waves|sound]] based primarily on [[amplitude]]/power/intensity, but also [[frequency]]

- closely related to amplitude
- a perceived doubling of loudness â†’ depends on the person
  - approximately 9-10 [[decibel|dB]]

Loudness is measured in units of **phons** (perceived loudness)

As humans, our perception is subject to certain [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] phenomena.

- we have less sensitivity to **low** and **high** frequencies.
- we have greater sensitivity between **2kHz** and **5kHz** (human talking range) due to the structure/length of our ear canal

The wavelengths of these frequencies aligns with most people's ear canals, so our ear canals go into [[resonance]] when these frequencies are present in sound we listen to
