# Expander

Like a [[compression|compressor]], an **expander** is an amplifier whose gain is determined by an input [[audio-signal|signal]] level.

- has a [[threshold-drp|threshold]] and [[ratio-drp|ratio]], but expands the [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] instead of compressing it
- when signal < threshold, expansion effect becomes active and attenuates the signal

Expanders are typically used to make quiet sounds even quieter. They

- e.g. reducing [[noise]] in old analog recordings
- [[noise-gate|noise gates]] and expanders often used for similar purposes

Like compressors, ratio expressed as input change to output change

- below threshold, a ratio of 1:3 means if the input falls by 1 [[decibel|dB]], the output will fall by 3 [[decibel|dB]]
