# Spectral Composition

**Spectral composition** is a method of [[music-composition|music composition]] where composers take [[spectrum|spectra]] (any [[sound-waves|sound]]), analyze the audio through [[spectral-analysis|spectral analysis]] (FFTs), and use the resulting spectral information as compositional material.

- basically: music _about_ sound
- treat a **spectra** as a set of notes

## Harmonic/Inharmonic

For spectral and microtonal composers, the [[harmonic-series|harmonic series]] serves as an unlimited source of inspiration:

- instruments that exhibit the harmonic series in some way are good starting points
- any 1-D structure, like a string or column of air, exhibit the harmonic series in some way
- ex: stringed or woodwind instruments: pianos, clarinets, etc.

Instruments with [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] spectra are still useful and interesting.

- ex. drums, gongs, non-[[pitch|pitched]] percussive instruments

## Methods

In spectral composition, [[modulation-synthesis|modulation synthesis]] is often used as a tool.
