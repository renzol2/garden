# Impulse response

A filter's **impulse response** (IR) is the output of a [[filter]] when given an instantaneous broadband input [[audio-signal|signal]]

- "instantaneous": fast [[transient]] and fast release
- "broadband": large [[spectrum]]
- e.g. hand clap, balloon pop, very short full-spectrum [[frequency]] sweep
- IR provides information about a filter's behavior

Filters are categorized based on IR:

- [[finite-impulse-response|Finite impulse response (FIR)]]
- [[infinite-impulse-response|Infinite impulse response (IIR)]]
