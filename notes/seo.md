# SEO

**Search engine optimization** (SEO) is the process of improving a website's visibility by search engine bots, so that it can be accurately and reliably scanned and shown on search engine pages.

- each website is **ranked** by search engines, which then displays all websites for a search result in descending order of ranking
- SEO's goal is to _increase_ this ranking

TODO: take more notes
