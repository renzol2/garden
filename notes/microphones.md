# Microphones

**Microphones** are [[audio-hardware|audio hardware]] devices that convert acoustic energy from [[sound-waves|sound]] to [[electrical-current|electrical]] energy, outputting [[audio-signal|audio signals]].

Prominent types of microphones based on method of conversion:

- [[dynamic-microphones|Dynamic microphones]]
- [[condenser-microphones|Condenser microphones]]

Microphones also differ by other characteristics:

- [[polar-pattern|Polar pattern]]
- [[frequency-response|Frequency response]]
- [[diaphragm-size|Diaphragm size]]

Other types of microphones:

- **Ribbon mic**: dynamic mic with conductive metal ribbon suspended in magnetic field
- **Electret mic**: like condenser, but with permanently charged material, requires no external power supply
- **USB mic**: connects directly to computer with built-in [[preamplifier]] and analog-to-digital converter
- **Contact mic**: affixes to solid material, picks up vibrations through physical contact
- **Carbon mic**: pressure on carbon granules creates variations in electrical resistance (old design, infrequently used today)
