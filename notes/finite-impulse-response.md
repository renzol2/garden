# Finite impulse response (FIR)

**Finite impulse response** (FIR) filters are [[filter|filters]] whose [[impulse-response|impulse response]] decays to zero after some time.

- Referred to as "passive", "well-behaved"
- inherently stable design but fewer possibilities for [[spectrum]] changes
- less creatively flexible

Since FIR filters can be described as time series, applying an FIR filter involves using [[convolution]].

- They can be sounds themselves (a filter response is just an instantaneous, full frequency signal), but we usually listen to them by using source signals

## Views of a filter

We can represent a filter in both the [[time-domain]] and [[frequency-domain]].

We can get the [[filter-response-curve]] by taking the DFT of the filter's time domain representation.
