# Input channel

An **input channel** is a modular strip on a [[mixer]] that typically contains a combination of the following features:

- input signal jack
- [[mic-level|mic level]]/[[line-level|line level]] select
- input gain adjustment (Trim)
- insert effect jack
- -20 [[decibel|dB]] pad toggle
- low [[frequency]] rolloff toggle
- mute/solo buttons
- routing options for main/aux outs -[[equalization|EQ]]
- stereo balance control (pan)
- input channel fader

## Input Gain Stage

Many input channels have controls for [[gain-staging|gain staging]]. The input signal may be _either_ mic _or_ line level, but only one input gain knob per channel

U → unity → $\pm$ 0

**Bold font:** mic [[preamplifier|preamp]] gain

- set relatively high for [[dynamic-microphones|dynamic mics]], less so for [[condenser-microphones|condenser mics]]

Regular font: line level gain

- conversion between [[professional-grade-audio|professional]]/[[consumer-grade-audio|consumer]] line level
- matching [[instrument-level|instrument level]] to line level
