# What itâ€™s like being a data scientist

- Your _ability to learn_ is more important than knowledge
- Projects and problems will be ambiguous, unlike school
- You will always be somewhat uncertain about your findings. Your success is determined by how you _quantify_ your uncertainty (think confidence interval)
- "Every minute you spend in planning saves 10 minutes in execution" - Brian Tracy (productivity guru)
- Create _systems_ to prevent burnout; be _consistently conscious_ about your wellbeing
