# Soft clipping

**Soft clipping** is a type of [[distortion-audio|distortion]] that rounds the output gain of a signal, smoothly preventing it from going above a certain threshold.

- used to induce [[harmonic|harmonics]] to an input sound
- not as harsh or bright as [[hard-clipping|hard clipping]]

Common varieties include using cubic functions and `tanh`.
