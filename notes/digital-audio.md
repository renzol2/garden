**Digital audio** is the representation of [[sound-waves|sound]] in a digital realm. Digital audio represents sound as a finite sequence of discrete values within an [[audio-signal|audio signal]], with each value representing a measurement of air pressure at a given point in time.

## Key Terms

**[[sampling-signal-processing|sampling]]**: the process of periodically measuring the [[amplitude]] of an analog signal and assigning a digital value to each measurement

**[[sample-rate|sample rate]]**: number of samples taken per second

**[[quantization]]**: the process of approximating the measured analog value to the closest digital value

**[[bit-depth|bit depth]]**: the number of discrete digital values available for quantization (also called _sample resolution_ or _sample width_)

**ADC**: analog-to-digital converter

**DAC**: digital-to-analog converter

**sampling theorem**: publication on the mathematical limitations of discretization of continuous signals

- coined by Harry Nyquist, 1928
- also called [[nyquist-frequency|Nyquist Theorem]] or Shannon-Nyquist Theorem

**[[pulse-code-modulation|pulse code modulation (PCM)]]**: specification for computer digitization of continuous signals

## Sampling (disambiguation)

Sampling can have different meanings, depending on context.

- Using a significant portion of an existing work as a component in a new work
- Recording individual sound units from a musical instrument or other sound source, typically mapped to physical controls on a [[MIDI]] device and played back (see: [[sampling-composition|Sampling (composition)]])
- Taking periodic measurements of an analog signal (see: [[sampling-signal-processing|Sampling (signal processing)]])

## Digital Audio Standards

Across the commercial audio industry, there are [[digital-audio-standards|digital audio standards]] to standardize audio file formats.

## File Formats

There are a number of [[digital-audio-file-formats|file formats]] in which digital audio can be stored.
