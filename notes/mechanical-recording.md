# Mechanical recording

**Mechanical recording** is the original [[recording]] method through _strictly_ physical/mechanical processes.

- no [[microphones]], no means of electrical amplification
  - [[sound-waves|sound wave]] vibrations transfer _directly_ to stylus/lathe
  - stylus/lathe engraves impressionable medium
- inefficient transfer of energy, poor fidelity, media lacking durability

## Devices

Prominent mechanical recording devices include:

- [[Phonoautograph]]
- [[Phonograph]]
- [[Gramophone]]
- [[Victrola]]
