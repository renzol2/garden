# Jenny Oscillator

The **Jenny Oscillator** is a type of [[oscillator|oscillation circuit]] used for [[sound-synthesis|sound synthesis]], capable of creating a wide range of [[timbre]]s. Rather than producing [[frequency|frequency]] tones themselves, they add [[resonance]]s to an existing master oscillator.

They originated in the [[ondioline|Ondioline]], invented in 1941 by Georges Jenny, and is implemented in modern times by Haken Audio in the Haken Continuum and EagenMatrix SoundEngine.
