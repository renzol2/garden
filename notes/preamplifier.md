# Preamplifier

A **preamplifier** is a circuit designed to _specifically_ boost [[mic-level|mic level]] to [[line-level|line level]] with maximal preservation of [[audio-signal|signal]] integrity.

- USB mics have a preamp and an analog-digital converter built in
- preamplifiers (and many other audio definitions) are generalizations
  - implementations vary widely
- preamps can be standalone units, but are often built into other hardware ([[mixer]]s, audio interfaces, handheld recorders)
- labels on [[audio-hardware|audio hardware]] specify expected I/O level standards
