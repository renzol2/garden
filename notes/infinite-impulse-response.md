# Infinite impulse response (IIR)

**Infinite impulse response** (IIR) filters are [[filter|filters]] whose [[impulse-response|impulse response]] design involves feedback

- IR approaches but never reaches zero
- unstable, can self-oscillate (analog) or output explosive values ([[digital-audio|digital]])
- this feedback enables amplification of the [[spectrum]] (i.e. [[additive-eq|additive EQ]])

They are not applied with plain convolution - they use _feedback_ to produce infinitely long effects
