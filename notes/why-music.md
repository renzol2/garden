# Why do we make music?

Why do we partake in [[music-composition|music composition]]?

- being part of the _grand human creative process_
- because the point is to simply do, not be the best
- it's comforting in its absence

Observations about music as a creative outlet:

- it's not a science; there's no linear path of improvement
- certain types or pieces of music cannot be objectively better than others
- we haven't succeeded in making "better" music over time, since we still revere music from centuries to millennia ago
  - music is not supposed to incrementally "improve" over time, and rather music is a reflection of the people and their culture at a specific point in time; therefore, it makes sense to want to preserve music as it is _art_
- music is _fashion_ - it ebbs and flows, evolves, changes over time
- like fashion, music has no productive "point"

> "I think the worldview that every productive activity must also have an ultimate extrinsic purpose is an artifact of an industrial way of thinking about life that fails to extend outside of the fields where it matters, science and technology." - [Linus Lee](https://thesephist.com/posts/music/)
