# Rust

**Rust** is a [[programming-language|programming language]] focused on delivering high performance with low-level access alongside an improved developer experience compared to existing low-level languages like C and C++.

- runs very fast
- prevents memory leaks and segmentation faults
- guarantees thread safety
- stresses performance and correctness

Can be compiled down to [[WebAssembly]] for use in [[client-side-rendering|client-side]] web applications.

## Types

Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference.

Number types:

- `i32`, a 32-[[bit]] number
- `u32`, an unsigned 32-bit number
  - useful for small, positive numbers
- `i64`, a 64-bit number

## Standard library

Rust's standard library (`std`) has many useful packages:

- `std::io` (input/output)

Rust imports some packages automatically into every Rust program in the _prelude_.

- kept small as possible
- contains things used in every Rust program, like _traits_

## Variables

See: [[variables-rust|Variables (Rust)]]

## Associated Functions

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

The `::` syntax means that `new` is an _associated function_
of the `String` type. The `new` function creates a new, empty string. As a function, `new` is a common name across many types for a function that makes a new value of some kind.

## References

A **reference** is a way to let multiple parts of the code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times.

- Rust makes it safe and easy to use references

References are indicated by a `&`.

## Enums

**Enumerations**, or just _enums_, are types with a fixed set of values, called _variants_.

Examples:

- `Result` types, with `Ok` and `Err` variants

## match expression

Rust uses the `match` keyword for [[pattern-matching-programming|pattern matching]].

A `match` expression is made up of _arms_.

Each arm consists of a _pattern_, and the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the `match` expression fits that arm's pattern.

- Rust takes the value given to `match` and looks through each arm's pattern in turn
- the `match` expression _returns_ a value
- for error handling, using `match` instead of `expect` is one way of moving from crashing on an error to handling the error

Example:

```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};
```
