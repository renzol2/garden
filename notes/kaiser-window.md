# Kaiser Window

The **Kaiser window** is a one-parameter family of [[spectrum-analysis-window|window functions]] used in FIR filter design and [[spectral-analysis|spectral analysis]].

- approximates the [[dpss-window|DPSS window]], which maximizes the energy concentration in the main lobe relative to the total energy but is normally difficult to compute
- formed using a [[bessel-function|Bessel function]]
- discovered by James Kaiser from [[bell-laboratories|Bell Laboratories]]
