# Programming Language

A **programming language** is a formal language comprising a set of [[string|strings]] that produces machine code output.

- commonly used in computer programming to implement [[algorithm|algorithms]]

Examples of programming languages:

- [[Rust]]
- [[JavaScript]]
  - Supersets: [[TypeScript]], [[ReScript]]
- [[Scala]]

Every non-trivial programming language provides:

- primitive expressions representing the simplest elements
- ways to combine expressions
- ways to abstract expressions, e.g. name for an expression to refer to it
