# "Who will turn the knobs when I die?"

Notes on a MUS 409 presentation on the article "Who will turn the kobs when I die?" by Bruce Pennycook

## Software

**MIDI-LIVE** system, meant to eliminate the static structure of tape playback

1. formed accompaniment from short segments of [[MIDI]] data that could be triggered by the performer
2. took the acoustic instrument input, converted to MIDI signal, appied effects like [[digital-delay-line|delay]]/[[reverb|reverb]] in real-time

Has ported and adapted some of these works to Max/MSP

Wrote his own program in SupperCollider2 to use alongside Max/MSP and CSound

- a lot of his work has gone missing throughout the year
- constant software updates mean that sometimes, performers need to wait for his software to be updated

## Hardware

Collaborations with Eric Johnstone to create hardware to allow performers to interact with computer-generated sound directly

- Operating system changes

Examples

- saxophone neck strap with controls
- clarinet extension
- pedal board with MIDI input for keyboard & clarinet

## Performer

Used the interactive programs to give performers musical control over aspects they wouldn't normally be able to control

- delay/reverb
- certain dynamic control
  - ex. a harpsichord [[amplitude]] pedal
- color/[[timbre]]

Performer set-up/rehearsal

- sometimes, all the parts to play + parameters to control would be too difficult for the performer

How do performers know how long a digital segment is?

## Composer

Pennycook's thoughts:

- good collaboration with other musicians
- improvement for his own programs
- inspiration for musical interactions between acoustic and computer-generated sound
- always needing to update
- always needed on-site to help with performances
- eventually went back to fixed media composition

## Audience Perception

1. can the audience hear/comprehend that real-time interaction is happening
2. does real-time interaction sound/look significantly different than a high-caliber performance with an audio track?
   - his answer was no

## Preservation

Pennycook believes that these kinds of realtime electroacoustic pieces should be considered more as **art installations**.
