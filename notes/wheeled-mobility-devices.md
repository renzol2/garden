# Wheeled mobility devices

Wheeled mobility devices provide mobility for individuals who are unable to walk or move independently

- replaces the function of walking when using a acne or walker is not sufficient

Types of wheeled mobility devices

- Manual wheelchair
- Power wheelchair
- Scooter
- Power assist wheelchairs

## Manual wheelchairs (MWC)

- A human moves the wheelchair either independently or assisted by a caregiver
- MWCs that are independently pushed are classified by weight and the ability to adjust the rear axle position

### Classification

Weight

- a lighter wheelchair is easier to push and requires less force to move the device
- reducing weight diminishes forces placed on the body and helps to reduce injuries
- lighter chair = more expensive

Adjustability

- moving the rear wheels forward makes pushing the chair easier
  - user has greater access to the wheels
  - reduction in rolling resistance
- also aids in injury prevention
- more adjustability = more expensive

## Power wheelchairs (PWC)

A power wheelchair has an internal motor and is controlled via some type of mechanical interface (joystick)

- Classified by functionality
  - greater the extent of [[disability]] = more functions necessary
  - more functions = more expensive
- Many adaptations can be made to a power wheelchair depending on the functional mobility of the user

### Power seat functions

Power seat functions are functions that can be added onto power wheelchair to allow an individual with significant mobility impairments to independently change position

- Recline
- Tilt-in-space
- Elevating leg rests
- Seat elevator

### Controlling a PWC

- Most common way is with a joystick
- Many alternative methods depending on the individual's hand function

## Scooters

Scooters are primarily for outdoor use and difficult to use indoors due to wide turning radius.

- provides minimal postural support and stability
- primarily for individuals with cardiac or respiratory impairments
- can be broken down to fit in the car

## Power assist devices

Power assist devices are motor add-ons to a manual wheelchair

- decreases effort required to push a wheelchair
- gives mobility to a person with limited strength
- decreases force placed on upper extremities
