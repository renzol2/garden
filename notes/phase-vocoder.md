# Phase Vocoder

A **phase vocoder** is a type of vocoder-purposed [[algorithm]] which can interpolate information present in the [[frequency-domain]] and [[time-domain]] of [[audio-signal|audio signals]] by using [[phase]] information extracted from [[short-time-fourier-transform|STFTs]]

- allows frequency-domain modifications to a [[digital-audio|digital]] sound file (typically time expansion/[[compression]] and [[pitch-shifting|pitch shifting]]).
