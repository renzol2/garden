# Timbre Space

The **Timbre Space** is an application of [[multidimensional-scaling|multi-dimensional scaling]] developed by John M. Grey from CCRMA in 1975 that describes the concept of a three-dimensional space in which the [[timbre]] of different sounds can be categorized based on:

1. spectral energy distribution, from broad to narrow
2. timing (or [[envelope]]) of the attack and decay, from synchronous to asynchronous
3. amount of [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] sound in the attack, from high to none
