# Music composition

Simply: The act of creating music.

## Types

**Traditional composition** is what most people think of when they think of "composition"

- writing scores for solo or groups of acoustic instruments
- academic and scholarly in nature (seen in education, research)
- emphasis on form, harmony, melody, theory

**Production** is another avenue of music composition

- music production, audio engineering, [[beatmaking]]
- more industry focused
- emphasis on sound design, technology, and application of harmony/melody/form/theory
- digital tools, like with [[sampling-composition|sampling]]

**Songwriting** involves music composition with lyrical writing

- emphasis on song structure, narrative, lyrics, and application of harmony/melody/theory

However, there are composers, songwriters, and producers who blur the lines between these roles. Each of these categories involves the composition of music; the only difference is in the surrounding attitude, tools, and terminology.
