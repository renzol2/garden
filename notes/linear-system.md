# Linear system

A **linear system** in [[digital-signal-processing|DSP]] is a system where the following statements are true:

- summing two separate output [[audio-signal|signals]] from this system is the same as applying the system on the sum of the two dry signals
- scaling the system's output by a constant is the same as scaling the system's input
