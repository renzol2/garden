# Runtime

Runtime describes how long an [[algorithm]] takes to run. The most common way of ranking different algorithms for the same problem is by how quickly they run.

- ideally, we want the fastest possible algorithm for any particular problem
- in application settings, it is acceptable for programs to run efficiently _most of the time_, on all "reasonable" inputs
- in theory, it's often required that algorithms _always_ run efficiently, even in the worst case

Runtime is measured using Big-O notation.
