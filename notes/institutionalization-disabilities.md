# Institutionalization (disabilities)

Many people with both physical and [[mental-health-disabilities|mental health disabilities]] are unable to care for themselves independently.

- Institutions can provide services for people who are unable to live independently
  - Unfortunately, quality of life is impacted
  - Civil liberties are limited
- Many YOUNG people with disabilities (under 64) live in institutions

## Mental health facilities

- First hospital opened in 1773 in Williamsburg, VA
  - Still operational today
- Long history of abuse, intensive treatments, and neglect to persons with [[mental-health-disabilities|mental health disabilities]]

## Care of persons with mental health disabilities

Common treatments prior to 1950s:

- electric shock therapy
- Insulin coma therapy
- Lobotomies

New drug therapies were introduced in the 1950s

- greatly improved the care provided and ability to manage mental health disabilities

Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963

- improved care and humane treatment of persons with mental health/cognitive disabilities

## Deinstitutionalization

A national deinstitutionalization movement was launched in 1965

- began with small community pilot programs for individuals who responded well to antipsychotic medications

1970-1990: Supreme Court laws limited involuntary institutionalization

- Minimum standards set for care in institutions

1970s - Medicaid & Medicare began to provide more coverage for mental health disabilities

## Current status of state mental health facilities

- Closing of state mental health facilities limits treatment options for people with severe mental health disabilities
- 40-60 state psychiatric beds per 100,000 people nationwide
- Treatment options
  - Nursing homes
  - Prison

## Nursing home care

- Inpatient facility providing 24/7 care
  - 1.5 million Americans are in long term care
  - Residents stay for an extended period of time
    - Average = 2 years
- Receive care for basic activities of daily living (dressing/bathing) meals are provided, provision of basic healthcare services
- Often not equipped to care for individuals with mental health disabilities or significant physical disabilities
- 37% of nursing home residents are under 65 y.o.
- 22% increase in nursing home residents under 65 y.o. (2004-2011)
  - Fastest growing population

## Why are young people with disabilities in nursing homes?

- often require assistance to perform activities of daily living
- if family or friends cannot provide the care, a nursing home is often the only option
- use of attendant care services could allow people with even very significant disabilities to live in the community
  - limited services are available
  - limited accessible places to live
  - may be cost prohibitive

### Problems

- often the youngest person in the facility
- must get out of bed/go to bed on the schedule of the facility
  - many people go to bed directly after dinner (~5-6 pm)

## Cost of care

- Attendant care in the community cost about 1/3 of the cost of care provided in a nursing home
  - Increased upfront costs to hire case manages, aides, find housing, and pay for the other things to make home based care work but less expensive in the long term
  - Established programs are cost effective

## Funding for nursing home vs. community care

- States are required to pay for nursing home coverage
- Supreme Court case: Olmstead v. L.C. (1999)
  - Considered discrimination to "segregate" people with disabilities in nursing home or other institutional settings
  - People are required to be given the option to live in the community (if medically appropriate)
    - Not well enforced
- Money Follows the Person
  - Established in 2005, expanded in 2010
  - Funded by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMs)
  - Helps Medicaid beneficiaries living in long-term care facilities transition into the community
  - Makes it easier for Medicaid funds to "follow the person" to a setting of their choice
