# Compression on Vocals

Below are some notes from various sources on how to use [[compression]] on vocals.

Goals:

- for **transparency** and **consistency**: preserve organic performance nature while keeping balance consistent, i.e. maintain consistent [[loudness]]
  - find compressors with fast attack and release times
- for **de-essing**: reduce harsh sibilance with a de-esser or appropriate [[multiband-compression|multiband compression]] configuration
- for **glue**: use [[buss-compression|buss compression]] on groups of vocals, ex. background vocals

Tools:

- 1176 compressor emulations
  - CLA-76
- SSL style compressors
  - Waves SSL G-Master Buss Compressor
