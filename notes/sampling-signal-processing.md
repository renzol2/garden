# Sampling (signal processing)

**Sampling** involves taking periodic measurements of an analog [[audio-signal|signal]] and assigning a digital value to each measurement, facilitating the [[adc|conversion]] from [[analog-audio|analog audio]] to [[digital-audio|digital audio]].

## Concepts

- [[sample-rate|Sample Rate]]
- [[bit-depth|Bit Depth]]
- [[nyquist-frequency|Nyquist Frequency]]
- [[Aliasing]]
- [[Quantization]]
- [[quantization-error|Quantization error]] and [[bit-depth|Bit depth]]
  - In general: greater bit depth means higher sample resolution, which means smaller quantization error, leading to better signal-to-[[noise]] ratio
- [[Dither]]

To convert an analog signal to a digital signal, we take a periodic sample of the analog signal. The value we obtain is the [[amplitude]] of the signal at a specific point in time, corresponding to the pressure change captured by some device.

We take a new sample at a specific rate, called the [[sample-rate|sample rate]]. Abstractly, this sampling process can be viewed as a mathematical operation:

$$x[n] = x(nT)$$

where $x[n]$ is a discrete time signal indexed by an index $n \in \Z$ from the original analog signal $x(t)$ recorded every $T$ seconds. (or something like that...)

Note that $T$ is the **sampling period**, which is just the inverse of the [[sample-rate|sample rate]].

The amplitude measurement must be represented in a digital format through a process called [[quantization]]. Since digital values can only be expressed finitely, we must assign a range of values to work with to represent amplitude; we call this range [[bit-depth|bit depth]].

The difference between the original amplitude measurement and our new, quantized value according to the bit depth is called [[quantization-error|quantization error]], which is heard as [[noise]]. We can mitigate this noise through [[dither]]ing.

Due to the finite number of samples we can take in a given point in time, there is a limited number of high [[frequency|frequencies]] we can digitally represent. This limit is determined by the [[nyquist-frequency|Nyquist frequency]].

Any frequencies above that limit causes [[aliasing]].
