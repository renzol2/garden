# Parallel Compression

Parallel compression is a [[compression|compression]] technique that involves blending an original [[dry-wet-signal|dry signal]] with a compressed duplicate of the original signal (wet)

- offers a "best of both worlds" between the [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] of an uncompressed track and the control of a compressed track by applying compression "in parallel"
- raises the [[noise-floor|noise floor]] in usually desirable ways, raising perceived [[loudness]] without raising the [[audio-signal|signal]]'s [[amplitude]] too much

## Steps

- Begin with a dry, uncompressed track
- Duplicate that track
- Generally, apply heavy compression that stuffs out the [[transient|transients]] (should not sound natural on its own)
  - high compression [[ratio-drp|ratio]], 4:1 to 10:1
- Blend the dry and wet (compressed) tracks together
