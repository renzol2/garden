# Hyperpop

**Hyperpop** is a "microgenre" focusing on exaggerating elements from [[popular-music|popular music]]. Some hyperpop artists include:

- 100 gecs
- Sophie
- Dorian Electra
- Alice Longyu Gao

## Common Instruments

Since hyperpop serves as an exaggerated take on popular music, it uses many fundamental elements found in popular music but in "exaggerated ways":

- **Piano, guitar**: usually [[sampling-composition|samples]], spliced or [[pitch]]-shifted drastically
- **Drums**: [[hip-hop]]/[[pop-music|pop]] drums, sampled and distorted/saturated
- **808s**: distorted/saturated, often to an extent most radio pop music would avoid
- "Earworm" **vocals** with heavy effects, heavily layered and [[pitch-shifting|pitch-shifted]] beyond realism

## Form

The form of hyperpop songs varies drastically across artists and groups; these current notes are only based on one analysis from [how to hyperpop (class_shift)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94l5jJ200rU).

### Intro

TODO: expand past notes taken from [how to hyperpop (class_shift)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94l5jJ200rU)

Hyperpop intros usually begin with a simple sample of 1-2 instruments, focusing on a core idea that gets manipulated or developed throughout the song.

Elements used:

- piano/guitar
- synths
  - simple [[sine-wave|sine]]/[[square-wave|square]] waves
  - atmospheric, [[reverb]]/[[digital-delay-line|delay]]-heavy pads
- vocals

### Chorus

Hyperpop choruses are characterized by **808s**, heavy **distortion**, and **exaggerated vocals**.

**808s**: within hyperpop, most artists either pitch-shift samples or create their own presents/patches for more control on the 808's sound.

- characterized by heavy distortion
- at its core: every 808 is a [[kick]] and a distorted [[sine-wave]] played at the same time
- many artists make their 808s _wide_, spreading across the stereo field

**Vocals**: hyperpop vocals utilize heavy layering and effects, forgoing realism and transparency for stylistic flair and exaggeration

- vocals are often layered; if not, they employ heavy effect chains:
  - [[multiband-compression|multiband compression]]
  - distortion
  - autotune
  - [[reverb]]
- when layered, vocals are usually harmonized in octaves and thirds (both above/below, depending on what's usually diatonic)
  - harmonies usually panned left + right for a wider sound

## Transitions

Transitions used in hyperpop are similar to those used in pop, but exaggerated. These include:

- LPF automation on the mix before the chorus to create a "future bass chord" type texture
- Dropping the bass or soloing the vocals before and after the chorus to increase contrast
