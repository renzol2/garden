# Multiband compression

**Multiband compression** is a type of [[compression]] that divides a full [[spectrum]] [[audio-signal|signal]] into discrete [[frequency|frequency]] bands and applies compression uniquely to each band.

- allows for more detailed control of [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]]
- compressed spectral bands are summed after compressions are applied
- often used to affect different frequency components of an instrument or vocal
  - ex. in a drum set recording, compress only the [[kick]] drum if the whole drum set is recorded on a single track

Multiband compression is a common mastering tool due to the control over different frequency ranges it provides.

- ex. applying moderate compression to the mid range of a track
- no need to use all bands on a multi-band compressor
- can be used for **de-essing**

## Examples

OTT (Over The Top) is a preset for Ableton's multiband compressor

- applies a significant amount of both downward and [[upward-compression|upward]] compression
