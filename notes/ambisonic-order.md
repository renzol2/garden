# Ambisonic order

Analogy to [[sampling-signal-processing]]:

- Downsampling is no issue, you just lose information. Similarly, going down in ambisonic order is fine, you just lose spatial information.
- Upsampling is requires generating information that doesn't exist. Similarly, going up in ambisonic order requires you to interpolate or "make up" data based on what you have.
