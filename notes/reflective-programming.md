# Reflective programming

In computer science, **reflective programming** or reflection is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior.

- in object-oriented programming, reflection allows for an internal inspection of classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime
- also allows instantiation of new objects and invocation of methods not normally possible
