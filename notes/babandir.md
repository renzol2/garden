# Babandir

The **babandir** is a bossed gong instrument played in [[palabunibunyan]]; it is the _timekeeper_ of the ensemble.

- played by striking the rim instead of the knob

Although the babandir must keep the time, the babandir player can play and improvise around the basic rhythmic mode of the piece.
