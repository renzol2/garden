# This Summer Stinks. But at Least We’ve Got ‘Old Town Road.’

Subtitle: "Lil Nas X’s smash single shows how digital media is creating a shared global culture in an otherwise atomized age."

Notes:

- "The unlikely story of the song’s creation and culture-spanning success suggests some reason for optimism about the power of digital culture to forge a shared perspective in the years ahead."
- "the story of media has been one of fragmentation and atomization"
- unprecedented wave of large choices to make for media consumption
- everything is "personalized and polarized" - our digital actions are tracked, shaped, molded by a "privacy-invading algorithmic determination of one's innermost sense and sensibility"
- more of us are enjoying the same media - the popular media is becoming more and more popular, and records keep getting beat
- "In music and TV, it’s the streaming business that’s changing everything."
- streaming has led to "quirkier hits that seem to come out of nowhere, and that stick around for longer"
- music industry used to be more top-down management in the 1980s
  - now, a song from small, indie artists and groups can be blown up online
  - Billboard removing [[lil-nas-x-old-town-road|Old Town Road]] from country charts was a moment of "top-down strangulation"
  - Billy Ray Cyrus pretty much blew it out of the water though
- "Until everything blows up, digital entertainment is leading to greater innovation, artistic freedom, growing diversity, and a rising sense of widely shared cultural experiences."
