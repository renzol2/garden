# Healthcare Needs and Policy (Disabilities)

Individuals with [[disability|disabilities]] have many unique needs related to health care vs. able bodied people.

- the true test of a healthcare system is how it treats minority populations

Healthcare needs of individuals with disabilities

- Expensive
- Thin margin of health
- Difficulty engaging in preventative health care
- Earlier onset of chronic health conditions
- Secondary complications associated with disability
- Required complicated treatments
- Require durable medical equipment and assistive technology

## Cost of Disability

- Living with a severe disability is expensive
  - Healthcare needs
  - Assistive technology
  - Home modification
  - Caregiver support
- Example lifetime costs
  - [[spinal-cord-injury|Spinal cord injuries]]
    - High tetraplegia = $4,633,137 (injury at age 25)
    - Paraplegia = $3,385,259 (injury at age 25)
  - [[cerebral-palsy|Cerebral palsy]] = $11.5billion
  - [[congenital-disorder|Congenital]] [[hearing-impairments|hearing loss]] = $1.9 billion
  - Intellectual disability = $51.2 billion

## Thin margin of health

- People with disabilities are NOT constantly sick or depressed
  - Often very healthy and take care of themselves
- Impairments and activity limitations make more people vulnerable to certain health problems
  - Urinary tract infections
  - Pressure sores
  - Respiratory infections
- Results in increased utilization of healthcare

## Use of healthcare resources among people with disabilities

People with disabilities often utilize

- 7.5% of all physician visits
- 9.1% of all hospitalizations
- 15.8% of hospital days

Higher percent of utilization compared to persons without disabilities.

## Difficulty engaging in preventative health care

- More difficulty for people with disabilities to exercise effectively
- Difficult to engage in aerobic exercise due to
  - Exercise equipment limitations
  - Secondary symptoms (pain, fatigue, spasticity, etc.)
- Physiological impairments
  - Individuals with cervical spine level cord injuries have difficulty elevating heart rate to training levels

## Earlier onset of chronic health conditions

Development of chronic conditions early due to impairments and difficulty engaging in preventative healthcare

- Arthritis
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Cardiac impairments

## Secondary conditions associated with disability

- Secondary symptoms have large impact on health and wellbeing
  - Falls
  - Pain
  - Spasticity
- Development of shoulder pain
- 31-71% of wheelchair users will develop shoulder pain over their lifetime
- Large impact on quality of life and communication

## Complex treatment

Once an injury or illness develops, treatments are often more extensive due to preexisting conditions

- Example: a person with previous breathing problems will take longer to recover from pneumonia
- Treatments may be more difficult/impractical to perform
- More extensive surgeries or treatments may be required

## Sustained pharmacological support

- may be required to take medications long term to keep themselves healthy
  - Long-term mental illness
  - Control of bladder function
- Medications can be extremely expensive
  - ex. persons with bipolar disorder utilize 3-4x the health care resources and incur 4x the cost compared to people without disabilities

## Utilization of durable medical equipment & assistive technology

- Persons with functional mobility limitations may require chronic use of a wheelchair or other mobility devices (crutches, walkers)
- Power wheelchair = ~$30,000
  - Medicare Pays (80%) = $24,000
  - Co-pay (20%) = $6,000
- Becoming increasingly more difficult due to insurance company rules and regulations
- Most insurance providers follow Medicare coverage rules

## Medicare DME Provision

- Pays for 80% of the device (co-pays can be significant)
- "In home rule":
  - Medicare will only pay for wheeled mobility devices that are suitable to be used in a person's home
    - Device must be able to navigate through all necessary spaces in a person's home
    - **Does not take into account environments outside a person's home**
  - can be very difficult for a person to receive funding for DME in use both inside and outside the home

## Use of long-term services

- May need to live in a nursing home or utilize person's care assistants
- Very costly for both the person and the healthcare providers
