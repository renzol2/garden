# Docker

**Docker** is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called _containers_ (Wikipedia).

- containers are isolated bundles of software, libraries, and config files
- containers communicate through channels
- containers share the services of a single OS kernel, leading to fewer resource consumption than VMs
