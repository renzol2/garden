# Medical model

The medical model is a [[models-of-disability|model of disability]] that focuses on what is "wrong" with the person, places blame for the impairments, and tries to fix those [[disability|disabilities]].

- largely developed by people without disabilities
- gave permission to "do" things to people with disabilities, rather than "with" them
- goal is to **cure** people of their impairments, not **accommodate**
- linear model = etiology disease -> pathology -> resulting manifestations
  - does not take into consideration outside influences on the person
- Medical-professional decides what to do with a person's "deficit" or impairment
  - Sick role: person is exempt from social responsibilties and obligations
  - Professionals make all of the decisions regarding their healthcare
    - initially was useful for practice in diagnosis and initial treatment stages of a disease

## Medical model and congenital disability

Families urged by professionals to treat and perceive a child with [[congenital-disorder|congenital disability]] as a dependent

- can lead to institutionalization at a relatively early age
- children viewed as incapable of making their own decisions, always waiting for insight from medical-professionals

## Real life application of the medical Models

The US Social Security Administration (SSA) defines work disability in a way that is consistent with this medical model viewpoint

- For the SSA, work disability represents in **inability to engage in any substantial, gainful activity** by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months

## Criticisms

- Ableist view
- Depicts people with disabilities as deficient and inferior
- The person with the disability is the problem
- Categorized able-bodied people in a more positive light and those with disabilities in a negative light
