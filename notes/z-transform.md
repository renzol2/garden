# Z Transform

In [[digital-signal-processing|digital signal processing]], the **Z transform** converts a signal (in our case, an [[audio-signal|audio signal]]) from being represented in terms of [[sampling-signal-processing|sample]] number $n$ to a representation in terms of [[complex-number|complex number]] $z$.

Some important properties:

- If we delay a signal by $n$ samples, we multiply its z-domain transformation by $z^{ -n }$.

Rewriting [[filter|filters]] from the [[time-domain|time domain]] to the Z-domain allows us to derive the [[filter-order|order]] of that filter.
