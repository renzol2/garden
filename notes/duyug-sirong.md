![Duyug/sirong rhythmic mode in cipher](../assets/duyug-sirong-cipher.png)

In duyug/sirong, all [[palabunibunyan]] players play phrases two beats in length, with emphasis at the beginning of each beat.

- the beginning of each beat is accented to signal an opportunity for creativity in improvisation
- the weak beats (sub-units) can be repeated or altered
- while improvising, players can either introduce new sub-units or reintroduce previously utilized sub-units
- stylistic options, like doubling of strokes, striking two gongs at the same time, or alternative uses of upper/lower gongs can be used in conjunction with repetition

## Form

_Duyug/sirong_ pieces begin and end with some conventions:

- pieces begin with gong 3, sometimes in conjunction with gong 2
- final section contains new musical phrases and ascent to gong 7
- _duyug/sirong_ pieces always end on gong 3 or 5 on beat 1
