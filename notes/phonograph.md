# Phonograph

The **phonograph** is the first device capable of sound [[recording]] & playback.

- [[sound-waves|sound]]-vibrated stylus cuts into impressionable medium
- initial conception: tinfoil sheet wrapped around crank-turned cylindrical drum

Pressure variations translate as vertical cuts (variations in depth)

Low level and low quality reproduction, impression degraded beyond recognition after few reproductions

- improved with hollow wax cylinders
- acoustic horn for greater sound transmission efficiency
- stylus moves laterally instead of cylinder
