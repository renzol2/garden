# 6 Points on Decolonization

The following are my notes on Derrick Quevedo's "6 Points on Decolonization".

TLDR:

1. **Decolonization is not a metaphor**: it is real, ongoing, and requires fundamental change in the way the world currently operates.
2. **Decolonization is violent**: current oppressive systems will not give up without fighting for radical change.
3. **We don't decolonize oppressive systems - we dismantle them**: colonial systems are inherently oppressive; they cannot be reformed and rather must be dismantled.
4. **Decolonization is communal**: individualism is a colonial mindset and leads to weakness and easy exploitation; decolonization is a progress done in solidarity.
5. **Decolonization is not pre-colonial**: colonization has had permanent effects on lands and peoples; basing "decolonization" on only pre-colonization leads to cultural appropriation, anti-indigeneity, and anti-Blackness.
6. **Decolonization is ongoing**: just as colonization is still an ongoing phenomenon, decolonization will continue until the world stops operating on the historical effects and current incarnations of colonization.

## History

[[Decolonization]] as a term:

- term may have first appeared in 1836 when French journalist Henri FonfrÃ¨de wrote that the French empire should end its 6-year rule over the Algiers
- subsequent use referred to the disestablishment of European control over its global colonies
- French West Indian psychiatrist and political philosopher Frantz Fanon published _The Wretched of the Earth_, a seminal text on the psychological effects of [[colonization]] and paths towards liberation

## Performative Use

Decolonization is often preached without practice as a BIPOC lifestyle brand or personality trait (Quevedo)

- misguided attempts at connecting with "pre-colonial roots" often results in cultural appropriation, anti-indigeneity, and anti-Blackness
- citizens of settler colonial states fail to challenge their participation in settler [[colonialism]]
- they import non-local foods and goods whose farming and production practices exploit indigenous and native communities elsewhere

> [Decolonization] is often confused with any social justice endeavor, including diversity, equity, and inclusion and often devoid of a critical analysis of power, history, and sociopolitics (Ijeoma Nnodim Opara, MD)

"Decolonization" as a term has been diluted in popular culture

- used by [[neoliberalism|neoliberals]] who are co-opting abolitionist language to appear "woke"
  - includes "lumpia liberals" in the FilAm/PilAm community
- accompanies performative statements and gestures
- pacifies the revolutionary nature of decolonization
- maintains colonial status quo without making any tangible decolonial process

## In the Right

"Decolonization" and other [[critical-race-theory|Critical Race Theory]] terms (including variants of "colonization") have become contentious buzzwords for white fragility in right-leaning communities

- contentious among those empowered by their adjacency to whiteness
- some claiming "colonizer" as a racial slur
  - false basis: not all colonizers have been white, and [[reverse-racism|reverse racism]] isn't real

## 1. Decolonization is not a metaphor

> National liberation, the struggle against colonialism, the construction of peace, progress and independence are hollow words devoid of any significance unless they can be translated into a real improvement of living conditions. - Amilcar Cabral

Decolonization is revolution.

- a radical and fundamental change
- actively depowering the colonizer and dismantling their systems of oppression
- remains a militant resistance against invasive states who intend on violating and dominating others
- colonized communities are fighting for their lives

## 2. Decolonization is violent

> Decolonization is always a violent phenomenon - **Frantz Fanon**, _The Wretched of the Earth_

Decolonization is violent because colonization is violent in many ways:

- enforcing legal, military, and political authority
- exploiting land and labor
- spreading [[colonial-mentality|colonial mentality]] and controlling thoughts

Colonial power does not give up authority willingly or easily - undoing colonization is inevitably a struggle, but a necessary one.

## 3. We don't decolonize oppressive colonial systems - we dismantle them

> The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house - Audre Lorde

White supremacist institutions are dependent on colonial systems and structures, including

- gatekeeping power and authority from colonized communities
- upholding [[Eurocentrism]]
- inherently reliant on exploitation

Removing all traces of [[colonialism]] from their structures prevents institutions from supporting themselves.

## 4. Decolonization is communal

In many pre-colonial, indigenous, and native societies, _community_ is survival

- "[[rugged-individualism|rugged individualism]]" and competitive [[capitalism]] are colonizer's tools
- removal of colonial control means removing [[toxic-individualism|toxic individualism]]
  - leads to easy exploitation due to being weaker while divided

Moving forward in solidarity means engaging with and uplifting each other through processes of decolonization: dismantle the power together, heal together, grow together, build together.

## 5. Decolonization is not pre-colonization

Decolonization is about removing colonial authority and control.

- not to be conflated with a return to the absence of any and all colonial influence

"Pre-colonial" is impossible: many lands and peoples are irrevocably changed by colonization

- ex. diasporas created by colonial displacement who can neither support (nor be supported by) their now destabilized homelands if they [[repatriation|repatriated]] them

## 6. Decolonization is ongoing

> If colonization made the modern world, decolonization cannot be complete until the world - including Europe - is remade." - Adom Getachew

[[Colonialism]] is a structure, not an event.

- anyone who participates in a settler colonial state benefits from [[colonialism]]
  - citizens, military and law enforcement, political leadership
- many current global powers exist through colonial exploitation and regional destabilization, which is _still ongoing_
- until we stop operating on both the consequences of historical colonization and its current incarnations, decolonization will continue
