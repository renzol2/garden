# Loudness Units Full Scale (LUFS)

**Loudness Units Full Scale (LUFS)** is a measurement of the [[loudness]] of an [[audio-signal|audio signal]] that takes into account subjective human hearing.

Essentially, LUFS measures a signal's average loudness over time based on how humans hear [[sound-waves|sound]], since humans don't hear [[frequency|frequencies]] evenly across the frequency [[spectrum]].

LUFS is similar in calculation to [[root-mean-square|RMS]] calculations for audio signals, but LUFS utilizes the Fletcher-Munson Curve when analyzing audio.

## In music production

Often, producers and mix/master engineers aim for high loudness, i.e. high LUFS.

High LUFS can be achieved by reducing the [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] of a signal, using tools like [[compression|compressors]]. It's near impossible to obtain high LUFS without reducing the dynamic range of a signal.

## Streaming service normalization

Streaming services adjust the gain of uploaded audio files to ensure that listeners have a standardized loudness during their listening experience.

Therefore, to obtain high LUFS in a mix, engineers now prefer to master at the targeted loudness of streaming services, rather than near -0 [[decibel-scales|dBFS]].

| Service            | Loudness target |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Spotify            | -14 LUFS        |
| Soundcloud         | No loudness     |
| Apple Music        | -16 LUFS        |
| YouTube            | -14 LUFS        |
| Amazon             | -11 LUFS        |
| Beatport/DJ Stores | -9 to -6 LUFS   |
