# Inharmonicity

**Inharmonicity** is the degree to which [[frequency|frequencies]] in a [[sound-waves|sound]]'s [[spectrum]] deviate from the [[harmonic-series|harmonic series]].

Many acoustic sounds feature both harmonic and inharmonic content. [[sound-synthesis|Synthesized]] sounds often have to manually introduce [[noise]] or intentionally deviate from the harmonic series through arithmetic that avoids integer multiples.
