# Electrical Current

Electrical current is used to describe [[sound-waves|sound waves]] through changes in voltage over time.

There are two types: [[direct-current|direct current (DC)]] and [[alternating-current|alternating current (AC)]]. AC and DC are _not_ interchangeable

## Alternating Current

AC flows by periodically reversing direction (60 Hz in the U.S).

Analog [[audio-signal|audio signals]] is represented using AC

- continuous voltage change is proportional (analogous) to continuous, acoustic pressure change

## Direct Current

[[digital-audio|Digital audio]] signals are represented using DC

- DC current switches on and off, creating binary data for encoding sound wave information

DC flows in one direction along a circuit
