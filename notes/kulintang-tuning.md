# Kulintang Tuning

The [[kulintang]] set consists of 8 gongs laid in a row, with _no strict [[tuning-systems|tuning]]_, since the music style doesn't actually need a strict tuning system. However, there are broad conventions for the tuning of kulintang.

Traditionally, kulintang is tuned in pentatonic scale without a strict pitch center.

- doesn't matter if it's a major, minor, or even modal scale
- is generally roughly pentatonic
- usually, gong 3 is the pitch center

Kulintang players choose gongs that would fit the aesthetic of the music style

- [[music-composition|composers]] and performers cannot just choose 8 random [[pitch|pitches]] in order
- knowing how to choose the appropriate tunings will come after listening to plenty of music examples

## Examples of traditional tunings

The following tunings are laid out in the following format:

`[rough pitch relative to TET tuning]` (perceived Western mode)

- the comparison to pitches and modes in [[TET]] tuning is just for ease of understanding among modern musicians, who share Western music notation and language as a lingua franca

`G A C D E G A C` (C major pentatonic)

- common in the University of the Philippines - College of Music
- Kulintang master Kanapia Kalanduyan tuned several kulintang sets in the college this way

`G A C# D E G A C` (A mixolydian?)

- Harold Andre heard this tuning in a Maranao video once

`G A C D Eb G A C` (C dorian?)

- Master Aga Mayo Butocan owns a kulintang set with this tuning
- no exact "key center" in the Western sense

`A B D E F A B D` (D dorian?)

- same as last example, just transposed

`A Bb D E F A Bb D` (D minor, A phrygian)

- Harold Andre's personal favorite
- [[Maguindanao]] pieces often have long-lasting ostinatos on gongs 1 and 2, making them extra spicy

`A Bb D Eb F A Bb D` (D phrygian, A locrian)

- this scale is more commonly heard in Javanese music
