# Beatmaking

## Components

Five main components of beatmaking (MUS 499 BT1, Lamont Holden):

1. Composition
2. [[sequencing-beatmaking|Sequencing]]
3. Sound Design
4. DAW Skills
5. Creativity

## Composition

[[music-composition|Composing]] a beat can be as simple as downloading a sample from a library, to using the host of the compositional techniques, theory, and musical training and intuition at your disposal.

Many people use [[sampling-composition|sampling]] as a starting point for their beats. These samples are usually [[looping|looped]] to create repetition and build a sense of groove.

Holden's recipe:

- main components: _melody_, _countermelody_, _808s_ and _drums_
- the melody and countermelody should leave room for vocalist; chords are a simple, effective way to provide a "melody"
  - by "melody", he's referring more to the "core sample" of a beat

## Sequencing

See: [[sequencing-beatmaking]]

## Sound Design

Beatmaking is all about crafting a sonic experience for listeners.

Notes from Holden:

- Rhythmic elements should be panned center
- Not everything should be center panned
- Use automation to change parameters over time
- Use [[subtractive-eq|subtractive EQ]] to sculpt a sound
  - For synthesized sounds, be generous in subtractive EQ
  - For organic sounds, cut less to keep organic feel
- _Mixing as you go_ (i.e. sound designing your instruments and beat as you compose) can make the beat feel more complete and iterative throughout the process

## DAW Skills

- learn keyboard shortcuts
- practice, practice, practice
- get past the 40 beats milestone

## Creativity

Creativity is up to your musical intuition.
