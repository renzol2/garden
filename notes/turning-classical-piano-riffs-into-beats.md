# Turning Classical Piano Riffs into BEATS (literally)

Assignment for MUS 499 BT2

For this week’s video, I watched a video about how, Nahre Sol, a classically trained pianist, used classical piano riffs and motifs to create interesting and unique patterns for use in beats.

Nahre Sol claims that patterns in music contain different combinations of sound in a particular order in repeating or non-repeating fashions, both in classical and non-classical music. For example, the Alberti bass pattern in classical music contains both static and non-static elements; a consistent triadic structure that is played in such a way that creates movement, while also allowing the flexibility to change chords and create harmonic motion. She wanted to see if applying patterns of classical music would work in a [[beatmaking]] context.

In the video, her approach is to use riffs or moments from the classical music repertoire to input [[midi|MIDI]] information into a drum library, that being Battery 4. She found that playing the riffs verbatim often didn’t lead to the most useful results right away and she had to experiment a bit to get some musical results.

Some useful techniques she found to get more musical results are transposing the riff post-performance to get different drum sounds, ommitting some notes to create rhythmic gaps, and sticking to shorter, more repetitive riffs rather than longer, melodically complex ones.

Her resulting beat had a sort of mellow, breakbeat feel, with a drum beat that played in 4/4 but used the melodic contour of the classical bass pattern to add rhythmic interest that is unconventional but groovy.

As a pianist myself, my main takeaway is that I want to use my keyboard skills in more unconventional ways, and somehow finding a way to map keyboard patterns to non-keyboard sounds could result in unique sounds.
