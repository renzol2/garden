# Social model

The **social model** is a [[models-of-disability|model of disability]] that claims that **society** is the main contributory factor in disabling people

- people with [[disability|disabilities]] are an oppressed minority by non-disabled (second class citizens)

Essential elements:

- recognizes the interaction of structural and attitudinal variables that create disability in society
- recognizes the voice/opinion of people with disabilities
- acknowledges the political processes that oppress and deny civil rights to disabled people
- begins to put power/information within the control if disabled people and their organizations

Definition of the social model:

> While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences.

- Developed by people with disabilities in the 1970s in reaction to the medical model
- Focus is opposite of the medical model - focusing on society being the problem for people with disabilities
- Those with disabilities are often denied a share of common resources (ex. government buildings, institutions)
- Isolation and exclusion prevents full participation of people with disabilities, which results on the disability itself

## Examples of how society causes disability

- Deaf individual without a sign language interpreter
- Wheelchair user in a building without elevator or ramp
- A person with a visual impairment using a computer without screen-reading software

## Criticisms

- Criticisms arose shortly after development
- Atheoretical, no firm foundation based in science
- Some impairments with disability can be resolved by medical professionals
- **A combination of the medical and social model is needed to reflect society**
