# Sample Rate

The **sample rate** is the rate at which [[sampling-signal-processing|sampling]] occurs in a digital system. These rates have been largely standardized throughout the audio industry as follows:

| Sample Rate (samples/second) | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `32000`                      | only used in radio and transmission applications                                         |
| `441001`                     | 44.1 standard for CD-quality audio                                                       |
| `48000`                      | 44.1 and 48 common for many applications                                                 |
| `88200`                      | adopted by many professional studios and industries                                      |
| `96000`                      | adopted by many professional studios and industries                                      |
| `176400`                     | adopted by many professional studios and industries                                      |
| `192000`                     | adopted by many professional studios and industries, 4x the standard `48000` sample rate |

Sampling is an inherently **discrete** process.

- No knowledge of what happens in-between samples; this data is necessarily lost
