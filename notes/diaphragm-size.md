# Diaphragm size

[[Microphones]] are often categorized by **diaphragm size** into two categories: _large_ & _small_ diaphragm microphones.

- **Large**: slightly better response to low [[frequency|frequencies]]
- **Small:** slightly more accurate representation of fast [[transient|transients]]

Note: these are very slight differences, they are mostly the same
