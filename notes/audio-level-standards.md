# Audio Level Standards

**Audio level standards** determine the appropriate level for [[audio-signal|audio signals]] passing through a signal chain.

There are four main standard levels, from lowest to highest average voltage:

1. [[mic-level|Mic level]]
2. [[instrument-level|Instrument level]]
3. [[line-level|Line level]]
4. [[speaker-level|Speaker level]]

## Compatibility Issues

Certain compatibility issues arise when converting between different levels:

- $x$ level signal to $x$ level input is ok
- _low_ level signal to _high_ level input:
  - low level or noisy signal
  - poor signal-to-[[noise]] ratio (SNR)
- _high_ level signal to _low_ level input:
  - signal distortion
  - possible equipment damage
