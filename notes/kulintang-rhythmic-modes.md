# Kulintang Rhythmic Modes

The **rhythmic modes of [[kulintang]]** (also referred to as _genres_ or _patterns_) are basic rhythmic patterns that [[palabunibunyan]] players use to improvise phrases. Rather than learning written notation, kulintang players learn these rhythmic modes, which are performed as pieces.

These rhythmic modes are

- ways of viewing organization and repertoire
- musical units that bind together all five instruments in [[palabunibunyan]]
- distinguishable by the length of musical phrases and characteristic rhythmic/melodic flow

Each rhythmic mode has a basic pattern of popular formula that is recognizable to any performer.

## Academia

The concept of rhythmic modes for kulintang music is partly a dominant academic framework for understanding kulintang music, headed by pioneer in [[philippines|Philippine]] ethnomusicology Jose Maceda.

- even [[maguindanao|Maguindanaon]] practitioners explain their kulintang pieces in "rhythmic modes"

Maceda also uses the concept of the [[nuclear-melody|nuclear melody]] to describe kulintang music.

Ethnomusicologist Kristina Benitez uses the concept of "modules", akin to musical "licks" in Western music, to describe kulintang music.

- recurring musical phrases, 2 or 4 beats in length
- integrative of rhythm and melody
- occupy slots in the musical sequence of a kulintang rendition
- options selected in actual performance

## Modes

The following modes are outlined by Kristina Benitez in [[maguindanao|Maguindanaon]] terminologies (referred to in her studies as "genres"):

- [[duyug-sirong|duyug/sirong]]
- [[binalig]]
- _sinulog_
- _tidtu_

Each mode is identified primarily by

1. the number of beats in the recurring musical phrases
2. melodic and rhythmic groupings within the musical phrase
3. rhythmic emphasis

Most kulintang pieces begin and end on kulintang gong 3 (or gong 5 in pieces with 2-beat musical phrases). There exist some distinctive features between modes, but they can also be a matter of personal style:

1. opening formulas
2. cadential patterns

Pieces in a new style ([[bagu]]) feature many innovations:

- gongs 1 and 2 used in cadential figuration leading to a final stroke on gong 2
- opening with gong 4
- moving immediately to gong 4 after a few initial strokes on gong 3
