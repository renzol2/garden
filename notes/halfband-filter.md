# Halfband filter

In [[digital-signal-processing|DSP]], a **halfband filter** is a type of [[low-pass-filter|LPF]] with a cutoff frequency of one-quarter the [[sample-rate|sample rate]].

Halfband filters are useful for decimation-by-2 and interpolation-by-2, which is ultimately used for resampling and oversampling in DSP systems.
