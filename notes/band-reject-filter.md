# Band reject filter

A **band pass filter** (BPF) is a [[filter]] that _rejects_ [[audio-signal|signal]] energy at a **center** [[frequency]]

- also called **band stop** or **notch** filter

Opposite of the [[band-pass-filter|band pass]] filter

Useful for removing things (ex. 60 Hz hum)

Note: sometimes, the term _notch_ filter could refer to a filter that doesn't completely reject audio at a certain frequency, but rather attenuates it by a specified amount.

## Designing a band reject filter

Remove the [[band-pass-filter|band passed]] signal from input.
