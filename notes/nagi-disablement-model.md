# Nagi disablement model

Psychologist Saad Nagi constructed a framework in 1965 that differentiated among four phenomena:

- **active pathology** - interruption of normal cellular processes
- **impairment** - abnormality at the tissue, organ, and body system level
- **functional limitation** - restrictions in the performance of the person
- **disability** - expression of a physical or a mental limitation in a social context

> "Disability represents the gap between a person's intrinsic capabilities and the demands created by the social and physical environment - a product of the interaction of the individual with the environment"
