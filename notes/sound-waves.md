# Sound Waves

What is sound?

- Vibration occurring in physical medium
- Vibration causes particle displacement (disturbs particles)
- Particle displacement causes pressure variations
- Propagates away from source in all directions

`pressure variations = sound wave`

A sound wave transports energy/information, not particles themselves.

The particles themselves do not move from point A to B (although they do move) - it's the **wave** through particles that move.

While we think of longitudinal waves in 1 direction, it is important to remember that these sound waves move omnidirectionally

- Ex: If I clap my hand, the waves will go out in a sphere

## Wave Types

[[transverse-wave|Transverse]] vs. [[longitudinal-wave|Longitudinal]]

Sound waves are **longitudinal** in the air, but often _depicted_ as **transverse**

## Wave Features

**Compression:** region of pressure _higher_ than equilibrium (squished together)

**Rarefaction:** region of pressure _lower_ than equilibrium (spread apart)

## Waveforms

[[Waveform]]: graphical depiction of pressure changes at a point in space over time

- depicts _pressure / time_
- regular pattern of pressure variations, exhibiting a loss of energy over time

## Wave Phenomena

By nature, sound waves can experience the following phenomena:

- [[linear-superposition|Linear superposition]]
- [[standing-wave|Standing waves]]

### Reflection & Absorption

Sound waves can be reflected and absorbed by objects and surfaces (usually a combination of both).

Reflection patterns very complex in enclosed spaces.

Materials often strategically chosen to optimize a room's acoustic properties - _acousticians_ are trained to choose and implement these materials to acoustically treat rooms.

### Sympathetic Vibration and Resonance

**Sympathetic vibration** occurs when a sound wave encounters an object and causes it to vibrate in a similar manner

- e.g. acoustic guitar string vibrations transfer to bridge, body, and air-filled cavity

Objects have **natural modes of vibration** based on shape, material, density, elasticity

When stimulated at one of its natural modes, an object exhibits increased vibrational energy/displacement, called [[resonance]]
