# Compander

A **compander** combines the functionality of a compressor ([[compression|compression]]) and [[expander]] into one processing unit

- portmanteau of "compressor" and "expander"
- also called _Noise reduction_ (NR) units

Companders are historically used in analog tape recording.

- input [[audio-signal|signal]] is compressed to allow recording at high levels while avoiding tape saturation
- output signal is expanded on reproduction to attenuate tape [[noise]] and return peaks and [[transient]]s to original level
- result is a low-noise but wide [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] recording

Some advanced noise reduction schemes use companders in a [[frequency|frequency]]-dependent way.

- signal is split into several frequency bands
- each band is companded separately
- results in more transparent recording with less side effects or artifacts
- continuous glissandi or small irregularities can lead to audible (and potentially unwanted) colorations
