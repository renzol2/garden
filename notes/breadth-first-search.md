# Breadth first search

**Breadth first search (BFS)** is an [[algorithm]] for traversing or searching graph-like data structures that begins at a root node and explores all nodes at a present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. A queue is often used to keep track of child nodes that are encountered but not yet explored.

- good for exploring distances
