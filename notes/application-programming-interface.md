# Application Programming Interface (API)

An **application programming interface (API)** is a connection that allows two software applications to talk to each other.

- defined as a set of rules, usually implemented in software

Most public and private distributed APIs use HTTP as the transport, with three significant and distinct design approaches for building HTTP APIs:

- [[representational-state-transfer|REST]]
- [[grpc|gRPC]] (and Apache Thrift and others)
- OpenAPI (and its competitors)
