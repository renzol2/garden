# Life audit

> Life audit (n.): An exercise in self-reflection that helps you clear the cobwebs of noisy, external goals and current distractions, and revisit or uncover the real themes & core values that drive & inspire you. Also known as: spring-cleaning for the soul.

Steps:

1. In 1 hour, take ~100 post-its/cards and write a single wish or goal on every one
2. Sort notes into themes. This can be done iteratively, with as many or few themes as possible
   1. ex. Personal, professional, creative
   2. ex. Family, community, adventure, health (mind & soul), health (body), health (financial), creative side projects, skills, professional, writing, design, giving back
3. Plot wishes by time, where each note is categorized based on where in time each one is actionable
   - ex. _now/soon_ (immediately actionable but needs some steps/prioritization), _someday_ (milestone, long term goals), _always/everyday_ (deliberate intentions, mantras, and habits to live by)
4. Determine "pointless to purposeful ratio" - write down the 5 or so activities that take up your daily time
   1. Evaluate: do current priorities and time investments line up with your goals?
   2. Pivot: how would you change your time investments and priorities to line up with your goals?
5. "The law of averages says that your success is determined by the five people you spend the most time with."
   - Do you surround yourself and spend time with people who inspire and motivate you to go after your dreams?
   - Do you spend time with people who challenge your ideas and push you to do better? Who help you when you're stuck? Who offer advice and act as a sounding board for whatever you're working on at any given time?
   - Do you spend time with people who are part role model, part mentor, part co-conspirator in creative endeavors?
   - We often spend a lot of time with people who it's easy to spend a lot of time with
     > They are the friends and peer mentors where help given is mutual and thoughtful. Conversations are energizing and you each learn something new every time. Each contributes to the other’s happiness and wellbeing: you grow as they grow.
     > They’re the gems in my life, but compared to other relationships, they made up only a small sliver of my interactions. That needed to change.

Main three action items:

1. shift my time and focus my energy on the _gems_ in my life - the people who inspire me the most - and to work on inspiring them, too
2. find more gems and build a community around them. Build a community of creative collaborators and inspiring, motivated minds to meld with
3. share what I learn and encourage others to try doing the same
