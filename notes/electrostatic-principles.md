# Electrostatic principles

**Electrostatic principles** are a form of [[transduction]] that [[condenser-microphones|condenser mics]] use to convert [[sound-waves|acoustic energy]] to [[electrical-current|electrical energy]].

1. Power supply provides static charge between plates
2. Movable front plate vibrates in response to sound waves
3. As plates move closer together, capacitance increases, and voltage decreases (and vice-versa)
