# Headroom

**Headroom** is the number of [[decibel-scales|dBFS]] between the peak of an [[audio-signal|audio signal]] and 0 dBFS, where [[digital-audio|digital audio]] clipping occurs.

- [[compression]] is often used to increase headroom, after which makeup gain is applied to make the compressed audio signal sound louder
- the peak output level of a signal is matched pre and post-compressor
- results in the post-compressor signal sounding louder due to the [[noise-floor|noise floor]] and any other part of the signal quieter then the [[transient|transients]] raising in [[amplitude]]
