# Service oriented architecture (SOA)

**Service oriented architecture** (SOA) is an architectural style of software design that supports service orientation, where _services_ are provided to other components through some [[communication-protocol|communication protocol]] over a network (e.g. the [[Internet]]).

A service has four main properties:

- logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome
- is self-contained
- is a black box for consumers
- may be composed of other services

SOA is related to the idea of an [[application-programming-interface|API]]:

- an API may be thought of as a service
