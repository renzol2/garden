# Envelope

An **envelope** is a function representing change in some parameter over time.

- at minimum, an [[amplitude]] envelope specifies attack time and release time
- air particles, and therefore [[sound-waves|sound]], cannot move or stop instantaneously

## ADSR

An **ADSR** envelope specifies **A**ttack time, **D**ecay time, **S**ustain level, and **R**elease time

**[[transient|Transient]]:** envelope region during which amplitude is changing

**Steady-state:** envelope region during which amplitude is constant
