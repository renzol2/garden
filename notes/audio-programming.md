# Audio programming

**Audio programming** is the art of writing software that has to deal with sound.

- can be broken down into its two components: **audio** and **programming**
  - **audio**: anything that has to do with [[sound-waves|sound]] and [[audio-signal|audio signals]]
  - **programming**: writing software that will be run on a machine

Audio programming can be applied in many ways:

- involves around building VSTs, software instruments, hardware instruments from Arduino circuits, audio applications
- building [[filter|filters]], [[synthesizer|synthesizers]] in a digital environment
- involves application of [[digital-signal-processing|DSP]]

## Applications & purposes

### Synthesis

Concerns [[sound-synthesis|sound synthesis]] and speech synthesis (ex. text to speech synthesis)

### Coding

Encoding and decoding audio files into different [[digital-audio-file-formats|formats]], ex. MP3 files

### Enhancement

Speech enhancement (intelligibility) or sound enhancement ([[reverb|reverberation]], [[noise]] removal)

### Data analysis

- Measuring health or statistics of a telephone call
- Measurement of noise in a street

- Health measurement for [[loudspeakers|speakers]]

### Effects

- Audio effects and effects units
- Physical units or plug-ins (ex. VSTs) within a DAW

### Games & media

- Foley, sound effects, and music are an important facet of video games (and movies!)

### Simulation

- Replicating room acoustics
- Simulating acoustic properties of different materials
- Sound simulations for virtual reality

### Drivers

- Drivers: pieces of software that allows people to interact software with hardware
- Requires high speed of processing with 100% reliability
- A driver should always work under all conditions
- Sometimes involves cutting code to short pieces

### Streaming

- Music streaming services (Spotify, Deezer, Pandora, iTunes, Tidal)
- [[algorithm|Algorithms]] to deliver music over the Internet

## Background Knowledge

### Programming

- A [[programming-language|programming language]] like C, C++, and Python
- Software design & architecture
  - Languages are not the only aspect of programming

### DSP

- [[digital-signal-processing|DSP]] is the theoretical aspect that tells us what code to write
- Field covering algorithms that allow us to operate on signals

### Acoustics

- A field of science that treats sound as a physical wave
- Gives a lot of useful theories that lets us describe how sound propagates within space

### Psychology & Physiology of Human Hearing

- Often overlooked in audio programming
- Human hearing is a complicated process
- Some algorithms take advantage of the way we perceive sound to play mind tricks on us without us realizing it

### Music theory/musicianship

- Knowing how music works within our society allows us to know how different sounds interact with each other

### Probability & Stochastic Processes

- Everything about signal processing assumes we are looking at a stochastic process
- Helpful to understand what lies below the digital or analog signal we are looking at

### Mathematics

- Mathematics as a basis for many of the above fields

## Programming Languages

- Max MSP for more visual programming
- C++ is the industry standard for audio programming - also used in game development

## Frameworks

- JUCE is an audio programming framework
