# Ego Death

**Ego death** is "the renunciation, rejection and, ultimately, the death of the need to hold on to a separate, self-centered existence."

- experience similar to "kissing death itself"
- allows one to accept mortal limitations

"Radical plurism"

The self is the framework through which we find meaning. There are pros and cons to using this framework.

- on one hand of the spectrum, narcissism
- one the other hand, lack of direction and hyper awareness of meaninglessness
