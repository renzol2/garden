# Pi単a

**Pi単a** is a traditional fabric made from pineapple leaves in the [[Philippines]].

Pi単a fabric is made in 5 steps:

1. Pakigue
2. Pagpisi
3. Pagpanug ot
4. Pagtalinuas
5. Paghaboe

The final product is a fine, translucent fabric that is well-recognized as part of the Philippine attire.

## Pakigue

In this process, 2 fibers come out:

1. **Bastos**: a coarse and durable fiber used for string or twine
2. **Liniwan**: fibers that appear after rigorous scraping which are used for weaving into Filipiana attire

## Pagpisi & Pagpanug ot

Hand-knotting and trimming individual fibres to create one long, seamless filament

## Pagtalinuas & Paghaboe

Warping and spinning of filament, and weaving the cloth on an upright two-treadle loom
