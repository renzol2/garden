# Supersaw killer

A new method of creating chord stacks, using "chaos" modulation:

- Use two [[oscillator|oscillators]] (primarily [[sawtooth-wave|sawtooth]]), but can be any wave
- Use [[frequency-modulation|FM]] to modulate the [[pitch]] or [[frequency]] of the oscillators with two different [[noise]] generators
  - Can be a random [[audio-signal|signal]] or noise itself
  - The strength of the modulation should be ~20% - otherwise, it's too strong
  - This is the "chaos" that is used to modulate the signals
- Pan the two oscillators left & right
- Third (or additional) oscillator can be used if applicable

Some additions to this method:

- Assign some master control to the strength of the noise modulation for an "intensity" knob
- Use envelopes with short decay/sustain to create an attack
- Use LPF filter (a higher one like -18 or -24 dB/oct works best) & cutoff frequency modulation for filtering effects
- Use delay, reverb, & compression for post-processing
- Mess with chord voicings to produce better results
