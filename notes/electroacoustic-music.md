# Electroacoustic Music

**Electroacoustic music** is music that depends on electronic technology for its creation/[[music-composition|composition]] and performance, referring to a practice that emerged during the early/mid-twentieth century and continues to develop today.

Simplified definition by [Hanna Bosma](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/organised-sound/article/bodies-of-evidence-singing-cyborgs-and-other-gender-issues-in-electrovocal-music/E4F75A88AC039AFF095986A4977A0D0F):

> Music in which the use of electronic equipment is essential, and which is not [[pop-music|pop music]]; mostly without commercial success, and often related to universities, conservatories, art institutions or non-commercial radio stations

Other terms: [[computer-music|computer music]], acousmatic music, [[musique-concrete|musique concrete]], [[tape]] music, radiophonic art, sound art, soundscapes, etc.

## Differentiation between electronic and electroacoustic

Difference between _electronic_ and _electroacoustic_ music is debatable

- terms are sometimes used interchangeably
- electroacoustic music tends to be used as a more all-encompassing term
  - often implies a connection with academia and research.

_Electronic_ music often refers to popular [[synthesizer]] music, or popular electronic dance music (EDM) and ambient music.
