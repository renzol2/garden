# Delay and sum beamformer

The **delay and sum beamformer** is the most basic kind of [[beamformer]] that steers a [[microphone-array|microphone array]] to look towards any angle, which boosts [[sound-waves|sound]] from the steered direction.

- We can also manipulate the steering vector to cancel out sounds from a specific direction
