# Just Tuning

A [[tuning-systems|tuning system]] based on the [[harmonic-series|harmonic series]], comprised of mathematically simple (integer) intervals.

## Frequency Ratios

Distance between _any_ two harmonics can be expressed in terms of [[frequency|frequency]] ratios $f_1/f_2$ and reciprocals $f_2/f_1$.

- Ratio 2/1 = octave up, reciprocal 1/2 = octave down
- Ratio 3/2 = fifth up, reciprocal 2/3 = fifth down
