# Colonial mentality

**Colonial mentality** is "a form of internalized oppression that conditions colonized people to believe that their ethnic or cultural identity is inferior to Western culture or whiteness." (Asian Mental Health Project)

- people under colonial mentality strive towards westernization and stray away from indigenous roots
- results in uncritical rejection of anything from original culture (ex. Filipino) and uncritical preference for anything Western (American)
