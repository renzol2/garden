# Buss

A **buss** is a point in an [[audio-signal|audio signal]] flow where multiple inputs merge into a single output

- called _groups_ in some DAWs, like Ableton

Routing multiple inputs into busses allows a single effect or effects chain to be applied to all inputs at once

- ex. [[buss-compression|buss compression]] to "glue" individual elements together
