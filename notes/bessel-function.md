# Bessel Function

**Bessel functions** are solutions of Bessel's differential equations. They are characterized further into categories like _cylinder functions_ and _spherical Bessel functions_.

## Applications

Bessel functions have applications in

- signal processing
- [[frequency-modulation|FM synthesis]]
- developing [[kaiser-window|Kaiser windows]]
- developing [[filter|filters]], like the Bessel filter

TODO: look up relationship to [[harmonic-series]]
