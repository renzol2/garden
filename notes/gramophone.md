# Gramophone

(box with a horn)

The **gramophone** is an early [[mechanical-recording|mechanical recording]] device similar in some ways to the [[phonograph]]:

- impressionable, wax medium
- stylus to cut into wax
- creates grooves into the wax

Different mechanism avoided patent infringement:

- lateral-cut wax disc
- pressure variations as lateral stylus cuts
- inverted disc as master copy for mass reproduction

## vs. Phonograph

The debate between using the gramophone vs. the phonograph was the first "media format war"

Lateral disc commercially overtook cylinder ca. 1920

- more convenient to store
- slightly cheaper to manufacture
- slightly louder in sound reproduction

mechanical improvements: stable spring-wound motors

This debate marked the beginnings of the music industry
