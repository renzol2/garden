# Income Inequality

**Income inequality** is the economic gap within a demographic of people (ex. race, gender, disability)

- a measure of the economic gap between the rich and the poor ([Kochhar and Cilluffo](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/))
- affects different race groups differently
- often measured by the [[90-10-ratio|90/10 ratio]], which varies widely by race/ethnicity

Income inequality is driven by several factors since 1970:

- technological change
- globalization
- decline of unions
- eroding value of the minimum wage
- [[capitalism]]

These drivers have a disproportionate impact on differing racial and ethnic groups, caused by

- educational attainment
- share of foreign born
- disproportionate incarceration
  - ex. disparately high rate of incarceration among Black men
- discrimination (historical legacy and current impact)

## Asians & Asian-Americans in the US

From [Income Inequality in the U.S. Is Rising Most Rapidly Among Asians (Pew Research Center)](#sources)

Asians living in the U.S. experienced the highest increase in income equality from 1970 to 2016

- i.e. Asians are one of the most "economically divided" groups in the U.S.
- simultaneously the highest earning racial group and ethnic group in the U.S. _and_ the lowest gains in income for low-income families
- in 2016:
  - Asians at the 90th percentile of their income distribution had 10.7 times the income of Asians at the 10th percentile
  - compared with Blacks (9.8), whites (7.8), and Hispanics (7.8)
  - i.e. the highest earning Asians in the U.S. earn **over 10 times** more than the lowest earning Asians
- the top-to-bottom gap in income among Asians increased 77% from 1970 to 2016
  - compared to whites (24%), Hispanics (15%), and Blacks (7%)
- Asians near the top experienced more growth than any other group from 1970 to 2016, while Asians near the bottom experienced the least growth

## Disability

Between 1981 and 2018, income inequality between households with work limitations has consistently been 30% higher than households without work limitations. [[disability|Disability]] considerations should be part of research and policy on income inequality.

### Causes

Income inequality in Asians living in the U.S. is partly driven by immigration

- immigrants accounted for 81% of growth in the Asian adult population between 1970 and 2016
- followed by the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965 and the end of the war in Vietnam in 1975, bringing in waves of refugees and separated family members
- resulted in more Asian immigrants working in low-skill occupations

Immigration Act of 1990 sought to increase the inflow of skilled immigrants coinciding with boom in technology sector

- H-1B visa program

Education levels and incomes vary widely among Asians, largely across different ethnicities (diversity in origins and experiences of Asians in the U.S.)

- 2015: share with at least a bachelor's among adults 25 and older ranged from 72% among Indians to 9% among Bhutanese
- median household income varied from $100,000 among Indians to $36k among Burmese
- poverty rates ranged as high as 35% among the Burmese and 33% among the Bhutanese

## Consequences

Increasing income inequality leads to social and economic consequences

- people with lower income experience experience less...
  - economic opportunity
  - economic mobility
  - political influence
- creates greater geographic segregation by income
- harms overall economic growth by
  - reducing consumption levels
  - causing excessive borrowing by lower/middle income families
  - limiting investment in education
