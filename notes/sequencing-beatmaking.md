# Sequencing (beatmaking)

> Build it up and break it down - Holden

When producing, start with the _hook_ and build it up.

- Every other part of your beat: pre-hook, intro, etc. is a variation of the _hook_
- Intro = "naked" version of the hook
- Prehook + verse = less energetic version of the hook

## Creating new sections

When creating new sections of your beat, start with the _hook_ and either add or remove elements.

- When removing elements to create variation, avoid taking out the "essence" of the beat
  - The "essence" of the beat is the element that should remain nearly constant throughout the entire beat in some form
  - ex. a looped sample, a guitar riff, etc.

**Rule of thumb**: make something change every 4 bars.

Give the second half of the beat a different "feel".

- add an arpeggio, drop out drums, or do anything that distinguishes the second half from the first half
- by the second half, the listener already knows what the beat sounds like, so change something to make the second half different
- add extra transitions for more contrast

## Transitions

**Go by intuition**: if something feels good, stick with it and play into it more.

**Exaggerate** transitions - _be dramatic_.

- exaggerate **contrast** between sections
  - ex. right before and after the drop, remove all bass and only leave 1-2 elements left
  - this contrast will make the drop seem more impactful

## Recipes

- 8 bar Intro → 16 bar hook → 12 bar verse → 4 bar prehook (similar to intro) 16 bar hook → outro
