# Hysteresis

**Hysteresis** can be defined as

- the dependence of the state of a system on its history
- a dynamic lag between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly

## UI Design

A hysteresis can intentionally be added to user interfaces and [[algorithm]]s to make them easier for people to use. The term is used to refer to times when the state of the UI intentionally lags behind the user's input.

- ex. a menu that is drawn in response to a mouse click may remain on-screen for a brief moment after the mouse has moved out of the trigger region and into the menu region
