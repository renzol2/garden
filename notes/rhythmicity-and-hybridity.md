# Rhythmicity and Hybridity

An illusory duality between the acoustic and the [[electroacoustic-music|electroacoustic]]

- affects the way we perceive acoustic vs electro acoustic writing

"It’s all about rhythm."

Talk by [Stylianos DIMOU](https://stylianosdimou.com/).

- [[music-composition|composer]] of acoustic, electroacoustic, & acousmatic music
- sound designer
- improviser

## Duality

There exists a duality between the experiences of life and creativity.

### Life

Emulating the energy of the world

- nature, ocean, sketching, free-diving

### Creativity

Metaphysical dialogue with my surroundings

- music, painting, complexity, multi dimensional intricacies

An experience in one aspect can lead to revelations in the other. Ex. free diving → open eyes to multidimensional intricacies of life and experience

## Preliminary Ideas

- inspiration and raw intuition
- structure as
  - a liquid
  - as a sculpted organism
  - as a fabric

## Schema

- **Harmony**, the consistency of the whole
  - [[pitch]] content, rhythms, electronics, etc.
- **Motion**
  - thickness, porosity, luminosity, density, elasticity of a sound
- **Procedure**
  - sculpture of sound— instrumental [[sound-synthesis|synthesis]], anamorphosis, transformation of the spectral morphology
- Motion and Procedure lead to **Musical Gesture**
- Motion, Procedure, and Musical Gesture lead to “**STRUCTURE”** at the micro or macro scale

## .. on sound

- lines and shapes
- microtonal and multidimensional networks
  - deconstruction of the squareness of [[TET]]
  - see: [[microtonal-music]]
- liquefied rhythmic and intervallic structures
- multidimensional domino processes
  - imagine jumping between dimensions of sound
- amplification resulting to electrified sonic entities
  - a different way to experience music
  - new sonic palette
- threshold between [[noise]] and pitch

### Main Points

- multidimensionality
- gestures
- lines
- liquification
- microtonality, [[microtonal-music]]
- domino

## "Simplexity"

Delivering complex solutions in the simplest way possible

- the necessity to define frameworks of coexistence between complexity and simplicity
- artistic and technological frameworks that enable technology to be part of the creative process and the performance practice, while being as equally involved as human beings in the realization and final execution of a piece of music, a sound installation, etc.
- in search of a hybrid relationship that can be the ground zero if the reconceptualization of complexity either as a sonic or as a performance practice experience

## Extended hybridity of electrified soundscapes

coexistence of multiple acoustic and electronic entities

hybrid sonic twin — extending sonic capabilities of acoustic instruments and properties through electronics

## mixed, electro acoustic music

acoustic sounds

- metallic sonic qualities
- idiomatic frictions
- granulated textures (see: [[granular-synthesis]])
- chaotic microtonal clouds
- intricate sonic interconnections

electronics

- amplification
- fixed media
- DSP
- spatialization of sound

## Extended “acoustics” IR and convolution reverb

using [[reverb]] and grasping the sonic nuances that emerge during the traditional process
