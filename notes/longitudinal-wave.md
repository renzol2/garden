# Longitudinal waves

**Longitudinal waves** exhibit particle displacement _parallel to_ direction of propagation

- [[sound-waves|Sound waves]] in the air are longitudinal and propagate three-dimensionally
- Speed of sound in air: `v = 33.1 + 0.6t`
  - `v`: speed of sound (m/s)
  - `t`: temperature (degrees C)
  - Approximately 343 meters/sec under normal conditions
  - Temperate affects the **speed** of sound and can **indirectly** affect the [[pitch]] through specific situations (ex. brass instruments), but it **cannot directly** affect the pitch
