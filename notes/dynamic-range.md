# Dynamic Range

**Dynamic Range**: Difference between highest/lowest level of an [[audio-signal|audio signal]]

- difference between _loudest_ and _quietest_ part of a signal
- a big part of orchestral music is _large dynamic range_: the drama between the quietest parts of the piece and the loudest parts
- meanwhile, pop music generally has a small dynamic range to be loud across the whole song: for uniformity of energy, to be heard over background [[noise]], etc.

Dynamic range is controlled through [[dynamic-range-processing|dynamic range processing (DRP)]] techniques.
