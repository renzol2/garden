# DAC (digital-to-analog converter)

A **DAC** is a digital-to-analog converter, which converts [[digital-audio|digital audio signals]] into [[analog-audio|analog audio signals]].

- Involves going from [[binary]] encoding (specifically [[pulse-code-modulation|PCM]] in most cases) back to continuous voltage

The DAC is responsible for playback of audio from a digital representation to its physical counterpart: [[sound-waves|sound waves]].
