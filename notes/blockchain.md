# Blockchain

**Blockchain** is a contract used to facilitate transactions and track _assets_ across a business network.

- _assets_ can be either tangible (car, house, product) or intangible (digital files, intellectual property, branding)
- virtually anything can be tracked and traded over blockchain
- goal: reduce risk, cut costs for everyone involved

**Importance**: Blockchain runs on _information_.

- the faster and more accurate the blockchain is, the better
- provides immediate, shared, completely transparent information
- stored on immutable "ledger" (receipt?)
- accessible only by permissioned network members
