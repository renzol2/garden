# Frequency

The **frequency** of a periodic [[waveform]] is the number of cycles that occur per second, measured in Hertz (Hz)

- **periodic waveform**: cyclic behavior, repeatedly exhibits the same pattern
- **non-period/aperiodic** waveform: irregular, non-repeating pattern
  - also called _[[noise]], unwanted sound_

**period:** duration, in seconds, of one full cycle of a periodic waveform

inverse relationship between frequency and period: `f = 1 / p`

## Relationship

Below is the mathematical relationship between speed of [[sound-waves|sound]], frequency, and wavelength

$$v = f \lambda$$

v: speed of sound (meters/second)

f: frequency (cycles/second)

$\lambda$: wavelength (meters/cycles)
