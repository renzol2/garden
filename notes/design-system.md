# Design System

A **Design System** is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow teams to design, realize, and develop a product.

- a set of deliverables
- evolves constantly with the product, its tools, and new technologies
- allows teams to build and share systems of components
- facilitates the work of and between teams
- a product in and of itself

A Design System involves tangibles and non-tangible elements. Some tangibles elements include

- tools for designers & developers
- patterns
- components
- guidelines

Additionally, a **Style Guide** is a deliverable that details graphic styles (colors, fonts, illustrations, etc.) and their usage.

A **Pattern Library** integrates functional components and their usage in the product.

Many Design Systems detail both separately

Non-tangible elements include

- brand values
- shared ways of working
- working mindset
- shared beliefs

## Things to Include

1. Purpose and shared values - where are we going? Why? and How?
2. [[design-principles|Design principles]]: the guiding sentences that helps the team to reach the purpose of the product thanks to the design.
3. Brand identity & language - includes colors, fonts, spaces, shapes, icons, illustrations, photographs, animations, voice and tone, sounds, etc. These form the _alphabet_ of the brand.
4. Components & patterns - _components_ are the building blocks and _patterns_ are the building instructions to use components in a logical, consistent way, across all products
5. Best practices - guidelines and documentation to help teams develop

## Design System Distinctions

Some questions to guide the creation and iteration of a design system:

- How many people will use this system?
- What is their profile and are they mature enough on the subject?
- How many products must we align? On how many platforms? How many different technologies are we using?
- What degree of consistency do we want across our products?
- Do we want a _strict_ or _loose_ system?
  - **strict**: comprehensive, detailed documentation and processes for iteration
  - **loose**: frameworks that preserve freedom and experimentation for developers and/or designers
- Do we want a _modular_ or _integrated_ system?
  - **modular**: interchangeable and usable parts, suited for projects that scale and adapt quickly but more expensive to realize
    - fits large scale products in e-commerce, finance, and government websites
    - work with _atomic design_ in mind
  - **integrated**: focuses on one unique context with interchangeable parts that need a strong, often changing art direction
  - examples include portfolios, showcases, marketing campaigns
- Do we want a _centralized_ or _distributed_ system?
  - **centralized**: one team is in charge of the Design System and iterates on it. The Design System team works closely with other teams, ensuring the System covers their needs
  - **distributed**: several people _across_ teams work on the System, allowing quicker adoption of the System across different teams but requires team leaders to keep overall vision
