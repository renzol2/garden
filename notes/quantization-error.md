# Quantization Error

The discrepancy between an analog [[audio-signal|signal]]'s true value and its [[quantization|quantized]] approximation is called **quantization error.**

- the amount of rounding we had to do to fit the [[sampling-signal-processing|samples]] into our [[digital-audio|digital]] recording system
- quantization error is heard as [[noise]] in the digital signal
  - quantization is effectively adding a small random value to the original value of a sample - over many samples, this comes off as noise
  - noise itself is just random values in the digital realm

In general: greater bit depth --> higher sample resolution --> smaller quantization error --> better signal-to-noise ratio
