# Livengood Composer's Forum Presentation

## Four Elements

Livengood describes her personal style as a [[music-composition|composer]] through four elements.

- Openness
  - unforeseen possibilities, performer freedom
- “Jankiness”
  - [[noise]], glitches, ill-conceived ideas, noisemakers, toys
- Humor
  - purposeful or not
- Self-deprecation

## Pieces

- _Garage Piece_
- _Brittle Thoughts_
  - amplified ceramic tiles
  - amplified wine glasses
  - tenor sax
- _Scrawl Etude_
  - performers write instructions for each other

## When is jankiness warranted?

- why the “easy” path?
- resourcefulness and resilience, or self-denial?
- coping mechanism for limitations?
- what do I need, as a composer?
- being a silly person, but taking myself seriously

## Three more pieces

- _Soul Searching_ for sax quartet
- _wherever you go, there’s a human_ for tongue drum, voice
- _Bambuchla Shadows_

## Advice on how to find your personal style

- observe your tendencies
- live life, get older
- think about what you’re doing
- listen to your music
- compare to your music to others?
- know what you want as a person
- you likely know your style and have it in you: you just have to find it and make it work for you
