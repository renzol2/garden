# Universal Design

**Universal Design** is the design of products and environments ot be used by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design (NC State University, The Center For Universal Design, 1997)

- features that make a product more useful to persons with disabilities are built into the product
  - people without disabilities also benefit from these products

## Seven Principles

1. **Equitable use**: the design is useful and marketable to any group of users
2. **Flexibility in use**: the design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities
3. **Simple and intuitive use**: use of the design is easy to understand
4. **Perceptible information**: the design communicates necessary information effectively to the user
5. **Tolerance for error**: the design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintentional actions
6. **Low physical effort**: the design can be used efficiently and comfortably
7. **Size and space for approach and use**: appropriate size and space is provided for approach and use

## Benefits of Universal Design

- Less costly than modifying a product after production
- Often can avoid the "hoops" associated with navigating healthcare system to purchase a "medical device"
  - Insurance coverage, prescriptions, vendors, therapists, specialized maintenance, long waits
- More aesthetically pleasing

## Everyday examples

- Ergonomic grips
- Ergonomically designed office furniture
