# Sine wave

A **sine wave** is the purest form of vibrational motion, also called simple harmonic motion.

The [[spectrum]] of a sine wave consists of the [[fundamental]] [[partial]] alone. All complex vibrations are comprised of sine waves at different [[amplitude]]s by the [[fourier-theorem|Fourier theorem]].
