# Digital signal processing

**Digital signal processing** (DSP) is the use of digital processing (through computers or dedicated hardware) to perform signal processing operations.

- often involves the use of [[algorithm|algorithms]] in implementation to affect [[digital-audio|digital audio]] signals

Today, DSP is the primary method of audio processing and production because

- [[binary]] representation of data is the norm for storing and transmitting music and audio signals
- DSP is easier to develop since it's less dependent on physical, external factors that can affect real components
  - ex. no need to worry about temperature component precision, electromagnetic interference, etc.

The biggest limitation to working with digital audio signals vs. [[analog-audio|analog audio signals]] is that digital data has finite resolution, so we give up some details from the infinitely precise analog signal
