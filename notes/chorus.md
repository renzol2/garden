# Chorus

**Chorus** is a [[delay-line|delay line]] [[audio]] effect that occurs when a group of voices with similar (but not exact) [[pitch]] and [[timbre]] play at the same time.

- chorus can be achieved acoustically by having multiple of the same instrument (voice, strings, etc.) playing the same part
- chorus as an effect uses [[digital-delay-line|delays]], detuning/slight vibrato, spectral variance
- requires subtle, unique variations in each voice

## Implementation

The simplest implementation of a chorus effect would be to mix the original input [[audio-signal|signal]] with a delayed copy of itself. This copy's delay needs to change over time through modulation to achieve the slight variance important to the chorus effect (otherwise we'd just get a [[comb-filter|comb filter]]).

The input/output relationship for this simplest chorus effect can be written as:

$$
y[n] = x[n] + gx[n - M[n]]
$$

where $y[n]$ is the output, $x[n]$ is the input, $g$ is the gain value for the delayed copy, and $M$ is the modulated delay line.

This implementation is actually the same as the basic [[flanger]]; however, where chorus differs is that the chorus usually has a delay length between 20 to 30 ms, whereas flangers usually have delay lengths between 1 and 10 ms.

There's no definitive [[algorithm]] for implementing chorus, as many different implementations exist.

- most involve several [[variable-delay-effects|variable delays]] in parallel with or without [[feedback]]
- delay times modulated using low frequency [[oscillator|oscillators]] or [[noise]] generators
- for stereo and multi-channel chorus effects, individual signals generated by a chorus effect are panned across the spatial field, often with each signal receiving unique delay modulation parameters ([[phase]], frequency, width, etc.)
