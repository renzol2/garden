# Index increment

The **index increment** in [[wavetable-synthesis|wavetable synthesis]] is the amount of change for an index to a [[wave-table|wave table]] for each [[sampling-signal-processing|sample]].

$$
k_{inc} = \frac{fL}{f_s}
$$

Derivation:

![Index increment derivation](../public/attachments/index-increment-derivation.png)

Index increment and [[phase-increment|phase increment]] are essentially the same thing, where index increment has an implementation meaning whereas phase increment has a physical meaning (in relation to [[phase]]).

- Within a digital implementation, index increment is usually more efficient since there is less multiplication/division; increment is only recalculated when the instantaneous [[frequency]] changes

Directly from source:

> When a key is pressed, we set an `index` variable to 0. For each sample, we increase the `index` variable by $k_{inc}$ and do a [[wave-table-lookup|lookup]]. As long as the key is pressed, $k_{inc}$ is nonzero and we perform the wave table lookup.
> When index exceeds the wave table size, we need to bring it back to the $[0,L)$ range. In implementation, we can keep subtracting $L$ as long as index is greater or equal to $L$ or we can use the `fmod` operation. This “index wrap” results from the phase wrap which we discussed below Equation 5; since the signal is periodic, we can shift its phase by the period without changing the resulting signal.
