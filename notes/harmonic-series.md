# Harmonic Series

The **harmonic series** is the sequence of [[frequency|frequencies]] where each frequency in the [[spectrum]] is an integer multiple of the [[fundamental]], or lowest, tone.

A sound is _harmonic_ if its [[spectrum]] exhibits characteristics of the harmonic series; that is, if all its [[partial]]s are integer multiples of each other (i.e. they are all [[harmonic]]s)

- a sound is _quasi-harmonic_ if it is almost or mostly harmonic
- some instruments are harmonically rich and produce harmonic spectra
- others are [[inharmonicity|inharmonic]] and produce [[noise]]-like spectra, or produce both at the same time

The first 16 harmonics of the harmonic series can be closely approximated with standard musical notation:
