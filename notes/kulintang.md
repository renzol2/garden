# Kulintang

**Kulintang** refers to one of two things:

1. an instrument consisting of a set of eight bossed-gongs in graduated sizes arranged from lowest to highest [[pitch]] and laid over a (typically) wooden frame.
2. the form of [[traditional-music|traditional music]] originating in the [[Philippines]] that utilizes the kulintang instrument

The kulintang is played by striking the knob of the gong with wooden sticks

- played at moderate to fast tempos with little to no rests and no sustained notes

The kulintang is the main part of an instrumental [[palabunibunyan|ensemble]] along with other gongs and a skin drum, which are common among the [[Mindanao]] region of southern [[Philippines]].

The region contains different styles of kulintang playing across different regions, each with their own distinct styles of playing.

## Playing Techniques

Kulintang is typically played with _softwood sticks_. Depending on the weight and material of the sticks, the kulintang could have a harder or softer sound.

Traditional techniques:

- single strokes (simply striking the gongs)
- double strokes
- _sabay_: two notes at once
- grace notes
- damping the gongs
- ostinato (drone)
- hitting with the middle or end of a stick to produce different tones
- hitting the rim of the gong produces a sharper, more metal-sounding tone

Non-traditional techniques:

- playing 2 notes with one stick
- changing gongs in the middle of the piece to change the mode/tuning/feel mid-piece
  - takes a few seconds; can't do it while playing
- using sticks with rubber ends, like those for agung or gandingan, for a different and _rounder_ tone

## Improvisation

Kulintang music is **highly improvised!**.

- all the rhythmic frenzy by kulintang master performers in recordings and live performances are all _improv_

Kulintang players are not taught strict, written pieces, but rather taught how to improvise on [[kulintang-rhythmic-modes|rhythmic modes]] and patterns.

- difficult to develop a "feel" for kulintang rhythmic modes or patterns
- understanding these patterns takes practice and listening

## Maguindanao Style

The [[Maguindanao]] playing style is said to depict the "rippling waves of the sea"

- **rapid** and **fierce**

## Similarities across cultures

Many people relate kulintang to instruments in other cultures, such as the

- _bonang_ of Indonesian gamelan ensemble
- _khong wong yai_ in Thai music
- _kyi waing_ in Burmese music

Unlike these gong instruments, the kulintang has a much [[envelope|faster decay of sound. Its sustain is not as long]], resulting in pieces being played in moderate to fast tempos with little to no rests.

## Learning Nuances

- Harold Andre (Manila-based musician) learned under a Maguindanaon master (Professor Aga Mayo Butocan) in Tagalog, meaning he was taught in Tagalog (his language) and not in Maguindanaon (her language)
- she has crafted a way to teach kulintang in an academic setting
- not a strictly traditional way of teaching, so there may be lost nuance
