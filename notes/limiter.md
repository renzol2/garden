# Limiter

A **limiter** is a [[compression|compressor]] with an extremely high [[ratio-drp|ratio]], typically 10:1 or greater.

- "brick wall limiting" is an extreme form of limiting with ratios ranging from 20:1 to inf:1
- ensures no [[audio-signal|audio signal]] exceeds the [[amplitude]] of the set [[threshold-drp|threshold]]
- useful when mastering to increase perceived [[loudness]] or even meet certain loudness broadcast standards

Limiters are used when preventing clipping/overloading has top priority, e.g.:

- operating in a volatile digital system, such as live coding or a no-input [[mixer]] performance
- [[recording]] in a live concert setting to prevent overloading the absolute [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] of any component in the recording chain
- to prevent damage to irreplaceable equipment
- when there is only one opportunity to capture a unique recording
- more commonly, to prevent clipping during the analog-to-digital conversion process

Limiters use peak/[[transient]] tracking and/or a "look ahead" delay to properly anticipate and limit instantaneous peak levels.
