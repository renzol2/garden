# Prosthetic devices

**Prosthetic devices** are used to replace an absent body part due to trauma, disease, or a [[congenital-disorder|congenital]] abnormality.

- Many types at various levels of complexity to replace upper and lower extremities

## Upper Limb Prostheses

- Cosmetic - simply replaces the body part without functionality
  - important for psychological impact
- Functional
  - includes a control mechanism of the hand component (terminal device) and different replacement units (either for wrist or elbow joints)
  - two types of control systems
    - body-powered control system
    - powered devices (Myo-electric control system)

## Body powered

- simplest functional device
- body movement is harnessed to control the terminal device

## Myo-electric control

- Electrodes pick up microvolts of electricity produced by contractions in the muscles of the residual limb
- Signals are amplified and activate a motor
- Motor allows movement to control

## Lower extremity prostheses

Components

- Socket - forms the connection between the residual limb and the prosthesis
- Sleeve - provides suction suspension for the prosthesis
- Shank (pylon) - transfers weight from the socket to the foot/ankle
- Foot/ankle - absorbs shock and impact and provides stability

Can be cosmetic or functional as well

### Trans-tibial prosthesis

- "Below knee" prosthesis
- Socket connects to the lower aspect of the leg
- Complex ankle joint to allow for movement and stability over a variety of surfaces

### Trans-femoral prosthesis

- "Above knee" prosthesis
- Socket connects to the upper part of the leg
- Complex knee joint allows for smooth walking and ability to navigate a variety of surfaces, including stairs
  - C-leg

### Lower extremity terminal devices

- Used to replace the function of the foot
- Devices available to
  - enhance stability
  - energy storing capabilities
  - customize to athletic events
