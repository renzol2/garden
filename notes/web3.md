# Web3

**Web3** (or sometimes _Web 3.0_) is the vision for a _decentralized_ [[internet]], based on public [[blockchain|blockchains]]. It centers around ideas behind _cryptocurrency_ as a means of verification.

NOTE: Web3 is a **concept**: a vision, a collection of ideas, _not_ something that is owned

## Background

**Web3** serves as a continued evolution of the internet from [[web-1-0|Web 1.0]] and [[web-2-0|Web 2.0]].

- [[web-1-0|Web 1.0]]: static pages from server filesystems, content is mostly consumed by users
- [[web-2-0|Web 2.0]]: data held in databases, pages are dynamic, content is both produced and consumed by users and hosted on platforms supported by [[big-tech|Big Tech]]

## Decentralization

As it stands, Web3 is shifting towards [[blockchain]] and the tools of decentralization.

In Web3, you have full control and ownership of your data; you can remove or expose it to your will.

Data is held not in a single database hosted by a tech company, but rather held in several instances through public blockchain by multiple private computers at once.

- therefore, data cannot be simply deleted by a company
- higher risk of persisting illegal or hate-oriented content
- users themselves will have to decide how to moderate content

In Web3, companies would be run by a decentralized group called a [[dao|DAO]].

In Web3, your digital identity is not 100% connected to your personal identity. You can use the internet freely without being traced to your real world activity.

## Potential Ideas

- buy gift cards through **MetaMask** (cryptowallet) and pay with **Ethereum** (cryptocurrency)
- leave a like on your friend's post with a hidden wallet
- series of ideas will grow together and be incrementally implemented
- [[big-tech|Big Tech]] may be slowly disassembled by legislature, while [[dao|DAO]]s will grow to replace them

Web3 technologies and products are being supported by the [[web3-foundation]].
