# Phase-shift oscillator

A **phase-shift oscillator** is an electronic [[oscillator]] circuit that produces a [[sine-wave|sine wave]] output. It has a feedback network that feeds its output back into its input, which shifts the [[phase]] of the amplifier output at the oscillation [[frequency]] to give [[feedback]].
