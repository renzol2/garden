# Decolonization

**Decolonization** is the undoing and dismantling of [[colonialism]] and colonial status.

- refers to all liberation from colonial control and authority, whether over our lands, communities, bodies, or minds (Derrick Quevedo, @drrckqvdo)
- an ongoing process that involves radical, fundamental changes to complete dismantling of current oppressive systems founded by historical [[colonization]]

"Decolonization" as a term has been diluted in popular culture through [[performative-activism|performative activism]].

## Meaning

1. **Decolonization is not a metaphor**: it is real, ongoing, and requires fundamental change in the way the world currently operates.
2. **Decolonization is violent**: current oppressive systems will not give up without fighting for radical change.
3. **We don't decolonize oppressive systems - we dismantle them**: colonial systems are inherently oppressive; they cannot be reformed and rather must be dismantled.
4. **Decolonization is communal**: toxic individualism is a colonial mindset and leads to weakness and easy exploitation; decolonization is a progress done in solidarity.
5. **Decolonization is not pre-colonial**: colonization has had permanent effects on lands and peoples; basing "decolonization" on only pre-colonization leads to cultural appropriation, anti-indigeneity, and anti-Blackness.
6. **Decolonization is ongoing**: just as colonization is still an ongoing phenomenon, decolonization will continue until the world stops operating on the historical effects and current incarnations of colonization.
