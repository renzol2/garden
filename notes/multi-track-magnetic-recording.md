# Multi-track magnetic recording

**Multi-track magnetic recording** is a form of [[magnetic-recording|magnetic recording]] where magnetic [[tape]] developed to accommodate multiple, simultaneous [[audio-signal|audio signals]] (1950s-1960s)

- physical tape width split into recordable divisions
- space between to avoid crosstalk

Multi-track recording led to increased engineering possibilities:

- record four tracks simultaneously
- sum to monophonic signal via [[mixer]] and record to single track

Multi-track magnetic recording served as the conceptual foundation for DAW software and modern digital multitracking
