# ADC (analog-to-digital converter)

An **ADC** is an analog-to-digital converter, which converts [[analog-audio|analog audio signals]] into [[digital-audio|digital audio signals]].

- this conversion sacrifices resolution, going from an infinitely precise analog signal to a finitely resolute digital signal
- however, [[digital-signal-processing|DSP]] has become the primary method for dealing with audio due to its flexibility, reliability, and ease of implementation

The ADC is responsible for [[recording]] audio, translating [[sound-waves|physical sound waves]] into a digital representation of sound.

The behavior of an ADC is as follows:

- Have an [[analog-audio|analog audio signal]] in mind (either in theory or recorded)
- Sample the signal
- Hope to reconstruct the signal correctly, or with minimal distortion
