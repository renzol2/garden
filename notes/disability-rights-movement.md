# Disability Rights Movement

The **Disability Rights Movement** was a response to a growing sense of oppression:

- 59% of persons with [[disability|disabilities]] were afraid to go out of their home for fear of being mistreated
- 40% reported that access to public places was restricted by physical barriers
- 49% reported that transit systems were in accessible
- 66% were unemployed
  - 2/3 wanted to work
- Federal legislation did little to end isolation
- Rehabilitation Act of 1973 laws were not well enforced

It created a separation between the policy community and disabled activists:

- Shift from the idea of [[disability]] as personal tragedy to broader social critique of 'able-bodied' society
  - [[medical-model|Medical model]] -> [[social-model|social model]]
  - "The issue is the individual" to "the issue is an inaccessible world"
  - People with disabilities should take a more active role vs. responding to how society treats them
- Greater interest in initiating social change
- Shift from administration for disabled people by "experts" to administration by disabled people
  - Central philosophy of the independent living model
