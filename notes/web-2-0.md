# Web 2.0

**Web 2.0** is a period of the [[internet]] from 2004 and ongoing, where:

- data is consumed and produced by users
- the majority of data on the internet is stored by only a few companies in [[big-tech|Big Tech]], leading to heavy centralization
- data is sold by companies to advertisers

The following changes from [[web-1-0|Web 1.0]] were made:

- users became **producers** of content, as well as consumers
- content and data is uploaded to and held by centralized companies, becoming [[big-tech|Big Tech]] (Apple, Facebook, Google, etc.)
- data issold to advertisers, leading to **targeted advertising** and lack of privacy
- content on your feed becomes personalized by Big Tech to your specific account, by use of [[algorithm|algorithms]]
  - ex. Google's [[PageRank]], Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, etc.

This centralization of data is leading to a new, less-centralized vision of the web: [[web3|Web3]].
