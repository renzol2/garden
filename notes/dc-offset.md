# DC Offset

In [[digital-signal-processing|DSP]], a DC offset is the mean amplitude of a waveform.

- if the mean [[amplitude]] is 0, then there is no DC bias and the [[waveform]] is DC balanced

## Audio Application

Loudspeakers can be damaged while playing waveforms with a large DC offset. (Source: <https://youtu.be/8EK9sq_9gFI>)
